"April 30, 2019 17:00 pm +08",HLBANK,Are banks worth a second look as half of them fall below book? ,"HALF of the banks listed on Bursa Malaysia have fallen below book value, prompting questions as to why and whether they now make for a more attractive investment case.Bank valuations are often tied to their returns, and if a bank does not generate a return on equity (ROE) of at least 10.5% to 11%, its valuation is likely to be below book, a senior banking analyst with a foreign research house observes.He says the key to value hunting when it comes to banks trading below book is to look for profit growth potential, coupled with the capacity to lighten up capital.Banks currently trading below book — based on the order of lowest valuation — are Affin Bank Holdings, AMMB Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Building Society Bhd (MBSB), CIMB Group Holdings Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.Of the lot, the banking analyst finds RHB attractive as it has room for improvement through profit growth as well as lightening up on capital and releasing more capital to shareholders, given that it has one of the highest common equity tier-1 (CET-1) ratio of 15.5%. “Even with the latest capital buffer requirement of between 0.5% and 1% for D-SIBs (domestic systemically important banks) and the countercyclical buffer, RHB has room to release surplus capital,” he says.(CET-1 is a component of tier-1 capital that consists mostly of common stock held by a bank or financial institution. Banks are expected to meet the minimum CET-1 ratio of 4.5%.)As for CIMB, he reckons value can emerge should the bank’s plan to grow its Indonesian business take off. “CIMB looks interesting too as the stock price has weakened a lot. Its prospect for growth is Indonesia — it is one of the biggest drivers for its Foward23 plan. The Indonesian election results with Jokowi (Joko Widodo) winning should help CIMB as one of the things he is supportive of is infrastructure growth, and with that, loan demand will increase.“Another upside for the Indonesian banking business is the potential of the central bank reducing interest rates. If that happens, it will be good for margins for the banks there, which is the reverse of Malaysia,” he adds.He explains that for Indonesia, in the event of a rate cut, not only do deposits reprice faster than loans but funding costs for banks also come down first compared with Malaysia, where deposits do not reprice as fast but loan yield comes off first.Aberdeen Standard Invesments investment manager Evan Cheah is adopting a wait-and-see approach. “CIMB will have to prove that it can walk the talk with its latest strategy. It is a tough industry. As for its Indonesian business, Jokowi’s win may help in terms of the economy, but that may only be for the short term. Fundamentally, CIMB in Indonesia has a lot to do to compete with the top four banks in the country. Can it compete with the bigger boys?”Banks may be trading below book, but focusing on the fundamentals is key, he stresses. “It’s not just about valuation but also what the management of these banks is doing, plus their earnings track record over the years.”On AMMB, the banking analyst opines that the sale of its insurance business could act as a key re-rating catalyst for the stock as “that would boost its capital and bring its ROE closer to 10%”.“We’ve seen AMMB make strides such as selling off its NPLs (non-performing loans) and [it has also] tidied up its non-core assets by disposing of some … that is positive,” says Cheah.As for MBSB, which merged with Asian Finance Bank last year, he is keeping an eye on how the newly merged entity will “propel itself to the next level and how long that will take”.Although Affin’s valuation is the lowest at 0.479 times book, it is seen as one of the weaker banks operationally. Industry observers and analysts agree that its competitive edge lies in its asset management segment. Why the divergence in value?Banking analysts say the divergence in valuations boils down to the ROE, with banks generating below 10.5% likely to trade below their book value.Looking at banks’ ROEs in the quarter ended Dec 31, 2018, there appears to be a correlation between ROE and stock valuation for most of the banks.Affin had the lowest ROE of 5.94% for FY2018, followed by AMMB at 8.2% (for the nine months to end-December 2018).MBSB’s ROE was 8.62% for FY2018 while CIMB is at 11.4% but excluding its one-off gains that year, achieved an ROE of 9.6%. RHB’s ROE stood at 10.3%.The order of ROE for this group of banks trading below book matches that of their price-to-book (P/B) ratios.Those trading above book value are Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, BIMB Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd and Public Bank Bhd. Aberdeen’s Cheah points out that most of these banks have posted decent earnings over a long-term horizon, and this is important.“Alliance, the smallest one that is punching above its weight, is one of two banks that have seen NIM (net interest margin) growth in the midst of an industry trend of narrowing margins. RHB is the other bank that is seeing its NIMs expand,” he says.“The overall banking sector is seeing intense competition in cost of funds.”ROEs and NIMs aside, another thing to bear in mind when it comes to banks and valuations is capital. “If a bank generates ROE but is undercapitalised, it is meaningless,” says the banking analyst.The ROE for the group of banks trading above book is not in the same order as their P/B ratios. BIMB has the highest ROE of 15.4% but comes in third, after Hong Leong and Public Bank, in terms of valuation.Interestingly, Alliance’s ROE of 10.3% — the same as RHB’s — falls below the analyst’s 10.5% benchmark and yet it trades above P/B at 1.13 times. However, this was for its nine months ended December 2018.The country’s biggest banking group, Maybank, recorded an ROE of 11.4%, slightly below Hong Leong’s 11.5%, for the six-month period ended December 2018.Public Bank is still the outperformer of the lot, commanding the highest valuation of 2.14 times P/B and registering an ROE of 14.8% for FY2018. The M&A angleCould more mergers and acquisitions be in the offing owing to lower valuations?The banking analyst indicates that it is likely, but points out that a lot hinges on pricing and timing.The proposed CIMB-RHB merger did not happen in 2014 owing to the wide valuation gap between them — 1.6 times P/B for CIMB and 1.2 times P/B for RHB — he says, but notes that both have similar valuations today with no premium to book.“It’s easier to do an M&A today,” he adds, stressing that there has to be value-add in merging. “It is about merging with a bank that will help you make a difference in counter-positioning … because if there isn’t, why go ahead with it?”Cheah believes an M&A exercise is likely to happen in the industry as “we are overbanked”.“Whether or not it will happen is tricky as we have seen two failed mergers in recent years. We are looking at the banks closely just because their valuations are attractive. Each of them has specific issues, so we are still cautious. Plus, there is the overall potential rate cut and should the FTSE downgrade happen ... those are also risks to consider,” he cautions of global index provider FTSE Russell’s threat to downgrade Malaysian government bonds in its World Government Bond Index in September. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/are-banks-worth-second-look-half-them-fall-below-book

"April 08, 2019 10:18 am +08",HLBANK,SMEs should look beyond financing — HLB,"KUALA LUMPUR: Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can step up and scale up by seeking other assistance from banks besides financing, said a senior bank official, noting however that most SMEs do not appear to be aware of the assistance available.“For SMEs to expand, it is not only funding that is important,” said Terrence Teoh, the head of group SME banking at Hong Leong Bank Bhd (HLB). “Of course funding matters, but on top of that, how you collect your money and manage cash is equally important.“Most SMEs do not have as much resources as the [larger] corporate and commercial entities. They also do not know what they do not have, especially when they first start out,” Teoh told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview last Friday.Teoh said SMEs have not been able to use products and strategies to their advantage as banks have designed the platforms and systems for large businesses in mind.He added that this is because most SMEs need not deal with complicated processes such as imports and exports, compared to their larger counterparts.“We have tried to drive certain strategies and introduced products that we think SMEs want, thousands of feet above ground. But none in the boardroom are SME owners,” he said, pointing out that they are mostly professional employees of large corporates and banks.“We have since changed that,” said Teoh, who has more than 15 years of experience in SME banking.Quickly recognising that SMEs’ needs are less sophisticated, HLB has come out with the relevant digital business solutions. They include a simplified cash management digital platform, HL ConnectFirst Lite, as well as digital systems for human resources (Kakitangan) and accounting (Biztory).HLB’s tie-up with financial technology companies also allows SMEs to be equipped with merchant terminals at lower cost to help SMEs keep up with the increasing trend of cashless transactions.Teoh said embracing digitisation by utilising tools could help SMEs reduce labour costs and increase efficiency. But besides day-to-day operations, he advised SMEs to take a longer-term view, especially in future-proofing their businesses.“A lot of SMEs do not realise that they have increasing liabilities and that they do need the additional protection, especially if they borrow, to buy factories for example.“Also, they may think that they only need a 90% margin of financing to acquire that factory, without realising that moving into it requires more money to pay for legal and stamping fees as well as relocation of machinery or staff,” he explained.In cases like this, Teoh said SMEs could leverage property-backed financing schemes, such as HLB’s SMElite which allows SMEs to secure loans for property purchases and working capital financing.The scheme, guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC), allows qualified SMEs to secure loans of up to RM5 million for property purchases and refinancing, bundled with working capital requirements of up to a 150% margin of financing.In addition, SMEs could opt for bundled key man protection products financed by banks, which are fully refundable upon policy maturity if there is no prior claim. This could also serve as a saving plan for enterprises.“SMEs do not buy insurance because they don’t have the cash flow. So, we finance it and help them gain the protection and do savings. It all goes back to our mission of wanting to be the preferred banker of SMEs by helping to grow, expand, manage and protect them,” said Teoh.SMEs are key to Malaysia’s economy, forming 98.5% of all business establishments and accounting for 66% of total employment in the country. By 2020, they are expected to contribute up to 41% of the country’s gross domestic product, from 37.1% in 2017, according to the report on the midterm review of the 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-2020).Teoh said HLB — recently named the best SME bank in Malaysia by The Asian Banker — had some 112,000 SME customers, of which 60% fell under the category of microenterprises, as at end-December 2018. Last year, the bank registered a 25.4% year-on-year growth in loan disbursement.For 2019, Teoh sees the continuing momentum to contribute to another year of double-digit loan and customer count increases, especially with the growing lifestyle, wholesale or retail, and halal SME segments.“These are really good numbers, and we are still growing strongly. We really think that a holistic and comprehensive offering works best. It is no longer product pushing, but putting customers’ needs first.“It is because of the development of new technology that we are able to analyse needs and behavioural trends from the use of data, reach out and serve better. When they grow, we grow,” he added.Teoh said HLB plans to work closely with government agencies, including CGC and Syarikat Jaminan Pembiayaan Perniagaan Bhd. HLB is targeting to approve RM7.5 billion worth of loan funding to Malaysian SMEs this year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/smes-should-look-beyond-financing-%E2%80%94-hlb

Wholly owned by Mah Sing, Ramada Meridin is a 32-storey tower with 752 rooms in Bandar Medini, Iskandar Malaysia. It is located about 45 minutes’ drive from Singapore.“As this is our first foray into hospitality, we wanted to work with an established brand and hotel operator. Wyndham Group is one of the world’s largest hospitality companies, which owns and manages a portfolio of more than 55 world-renowned hotel brands, including Ramada hotels,” says Mah Sing group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum in an email interview.“In 2015, we signed an agreement with Wyndham Hotel Asia Pacific to use the Ramada brand for this hotel,” says Leong. According the developer, Ramada Meridin is Wyndham Hotel Asia Pacific’s largest property in Southeast Asia in terms of room count.“We held Ramada Meridin’s soft opening last July and we have been making sure everything is tip-top for our guests. The reviews have been very good so far,” he says, adding that the hotel is managed by Topotels Hotels & Resorts.According to the developer, the hotel offers a few unique selling points. “In most countries, Ramada hotels are positioned as business hotels. This is the same for Ramada Meridin. However, its strategic location close to [just 700m away from] Legoland, and its proximity to Johor Premium Outlets, also attracts a lot of holidaymakers,” says Leong.“To cater for both markets, we have three room categories — the deluxe room (323 sq ft), classic suites (646 sq ft) and premium suites (883 sq ft). These room sizes are larger than the average hotel rooms.”  The hotel offers state-of-the-art kitchenfacilites, a yoga deck, meditation deck, reflexology area, swimming pool, wading pool, aqua gym, two restaurants — Delish Restaurant and R’s Kitchen — and a barbecue area.“We have an award-winning chef — Chef Mozart Muhamad — who was a guest judge for Masterchef Malaysia. The little details make up a great experience for our guests,” says Leong.Mah Sing Group has a portfolio of 47 projects in Kuala Lumpur, Greater Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor and Sabah with an accumulated gross development value and unbilled sales ofRM26.6 billion.

(March 29, 93 sen)
Upgrade to outperform with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.05: Mah Sing Group Bhd has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with TC Goldyear Sdn Bhd for the proposed acquisition of a 4.63-acre (1.87ha) freehold land in Mukim Petaling, Kuala Lumpur for RM90.3 million.The land in a matured area with established neighbourhoods of Old Klang Road, Sri Petaling, Bukit Jalil and Salak South is just 800m to the Taman Naga Emas mass rapid transit station and 1.1km from the Kajang Dispersal Link Expressway and New Pantai Expressway.The news did not come as a surprise to us as we had anticipated landbanking activities (note that our sum-of-parts [SoP] valuation includes RM2.2 billion gross development value [GDV] replenishment).We gather that the land already has its development order in place with a five-times plot ratio for a serviced apartment and that the land cost is inclusive of development charges and improvement service funds. Thus, the land cost-to-GDV ratio of 18% is reasonable and should yield mid-to-high-teens pre-tax margins, in line with the group’s average pre-tax margins. The land cost will be internally funded, resulting in financial year 2019 estimated (FY19E) net cash position narrowing to 0.13 times (from 0.16 times).Overall, we are positive on the project as it will be positioned as an affordable housing project in matured areas of Kuala Lumpur, similar toM Centura and M Vertica, which have seen promising take-up rates.This will increase the odds of meeting, or even better, exceeding sales targets. We gather that sizes of the unit will start from 700 sq ft for two bedrooms with a starter price of RM428,000 per unit and there will also be three- to four-bedroom units as well.Average selling prices are expected to range between RM600 and RM650 per sq ft. Previews will likely start in the second half of 2019. The development period is over four to five years.Mah Sing’s FY19E sales target will be at least RM1.5 billion, according to management. This will be driven by RM2.2 billion worth of launches from its ongoing projects and more urban affordable units-to-residential upgrades of which 81% are priced below RM700,000. With its light balance sheet, we note that Mah Sing is still on the lookout for affordable housing land bank in the Klang Valley.We prefer to maintain our FY19E sales target at RM1.52 billion for now pending timing of the project’s launch and status of its inventory clearing process.We have upgraded our call to “outperform”, with an unchanged TP of RM1.05, based on an SoP discount of 63%. There are no changes to our revalued net asset valuation.Post acquisition, our GDV replenishment assumption is now RM1.7 billion. The implied SoP discount is in line with our universe’s valuation range (-1.0 standard deviation to historical trough levels), while Mah Sing’s positioning as an affordable housing player warrants the better end of our applied discount spectrum. Its forward price-to-book value of 0.6 times is at historical trough levels, while its average dividend yield of 4.3% (above peers’) provides some downside support. Given the recent share price weakness, this may be a good entry point as the stock is one of the year-to-date laggards for the year. — Kenanga Research, March 29",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mah-sings-mukim-petaling-land-buy-deemed-positive

These larger units would be ideal for buyers who are currently staying in older homes and want better security and facilities to cater to their young families and children.“For this target market, we intend to design three- to four-bedroom units.

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium

It was formulated by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government with the support of the Subang Jaya Municipal Council and EdgeProp.my.In his speech, Mahathir said the government is aiming to build one million affordable houses now but that it would need the support of the private sector and the people.“We wish to build affordable houses that are comfortable and suitable for families to live in.“It is pointless if the country is moving forward but our people live in a poor environment,” he added.Housing minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said one of the objectives of DKN is to improve the living environment of the people, especially the B40 group.“The first objective of DKN is to empower the local communities, to encourage the people to involve themselves more in community activities such as to manage and take care of the public assets in the community,” she said during the launch.There are 32 ongoing DKN activities in Lembah Subang 2 communities under the first phase of the programme, which the ministry aims to extend to 20 more PPR, out of a total of 133 in the country, by this year.Under DKN, the ministry is working with the private sector, including property developers, to upgrade the lives and living environment of PPR residents through corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.The property-related firms involved are Gamuda Land, Mah Sing Group Bhd, MKH Bhd, OSK Property, Sunway Group, Counry Garden Pacificview Sdn Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd, Sunsuria Bhd, and Henry Butcher Malaysia (Mont’Kiara) Sdn Bhd.EdgeProp.my is supporting DKN by helping to facilitate the partnership between the public and private sectors to empower and improve the lives of PPR residents. It aims to raise public awareness of the policy through news coverage, as well as having a dedicated website on DKN.  All the companies received certificates of appreciation from the prime minister during the DKN launch ceremony. Representing their respective companies were Forest City director of strategy Ng Zhu Hann, Gamuda Land CEO Ngan Chee Meng, Henry Butcher Malaysia (Mont’Kiara) executive director Low Hon Keong, Mah Sing Group managing director Tan Sri Leong Hoy Kum, MKH managing director Tan Sri Eddy Chen, OSK Group executive chairman Tan Sri Ong Leong Huat, Sunsuria executive chairman Tan Sri Ter Leong Yap, Sunway Group executive director and managing director of property development division Sarena Cheah, UEM Sunrise managing director and CEO Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib and The Edge Media Group chairman Datuk Tong Kooi Ong.A full-day carnival was held at the Puchong Indah padang in conjunction with the launch, with activities that included a community cycling event, aerobics, children’s soccer match, tug of war, colouring contest, an eco market and food trucks.The public also had the chance to visit more than 40 booths showcasing CSR efforts among PPR by the participating developers and EdgeProp.my, as well as by NGOs and public service bodies.This article first appeared in www.EdgeProp.my.

(Feb 28, RM1)
Maintain buy with a fair value (FV) of RM1.21: We have maintained our “buy” recommendation on Mah Sing Group Bhd with an unchanged FV of RM1.21, based on a 40% discount to its revalued net asset value. We have made no changes to our financial year 2019 (FY19) to FY20 numbers while introducing our FY21 earnings forecast at RM291.4 million.Mah Sing reported its FY18 revenue and net profit at RM2.19 billion (-24.6% year-on-year [y-o-y]) and RM271.6 million (-25% y-o-y) respectively. Its FY18 net profit was within our forecast but above consensus, constituting 103% and 109% of our and consensus’ full-year estimates respectively. The decline in revenue and profit was attributable to more new sales secured from new projects, which have limited contributions during their initial stage of construction. Its FY18 earnings before interest and tax margin remained stable at 16.3%, similar to FY17’s.Mah Sing recorded new sales of RM1.5 billion for FY18, mainly secured from new launches in 2018 which were mostly priced below RM500,000 per unit. For FY19, the management has revealed its sales target of RM1.5 billion with its focus remaining on affordable homes at strategic locations. Unbilled sales of RM2.38 billion will be progressively recognised over the next three years.Mah Sing’s balance sheet remained healthy with net cash per share of 27 sen as of FY18. We believe the group is in a strong position to expand its land bank with a cash pile of more than RM1.2 billion.The management has proposed a first and final dividend of 4.5 sen per share, representing a payout ratio of 40%. This translates into a yield of 4.5%. Based on our earnings projection, we expect the company to pay dividends of 4.7 sen for FY19, translating into a yield of 4.7%.Mah Sing has lined up several launches in 2019 with the key selling points being: i) affordability; and ii) strategic locations.In the central region, Mah Sing will roll out M Vertica Cheras Phases 3 & 4 (high-rise residential; starting price: RM451,000), M Centura Sentul Phase 2 (high-rise residential; RM350,000), Sensory Residence, Southville City KL (high-rise residential; RM344,000), Basil @ M Aruna, Rawang (landed residential; RM550,000), M Cahaya, Sungai Buloh (high-rise residential; RM250,000) and Icon City PJ Phase 2 (commercial).New projects in the northern region set to be launched in 2019 are Southbay City, Penang (high-rise residential; RM600,000) and Icon Residence, George Town, Penang (high-rise residential; RM1 million). Meanwhile, in the southern region, Mah Sing will launch the Orchid and Hazel @ Meridin East, Johor (landed residential; RM450,000 and RM487,000 respectively). — AmInvestment Bank, Feb 28",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mah-sing-seen-strong-position-expand-land-bank
"April 15, 2019 09:02 am +08",MAGNUM,When defensive stocks are no longer a bear-market safe haven,"KUALA LUMPUR: Defensive stocks such as utilities, consumer staples and healthcare are not such a good place to hide out anymore.Indeed, for Phillip Capital Management Sdn Bhd chief investment officer Ang Kok Heng, there is no such thing as a defensive stock in current market conditions.“Putting your money in the bank is a safer bet [for potentially higher returns] than investing in defensive stocks for now,” he told The Edge Financial Daily, pointing to today’s volatile, uncertain market and economic environment.Ang suggests using the bottom-up approach when picking stocks. This means investors should be looking for stocks that have good growth prospects or strong fundamentals.“If the [share] price is attractive and [the company’s] growth [prospects] are good, then it will serve as a buying opportunity,” he added.The FBM KLCI fell to a fresh two-year low last Thursday, closing at 1,624.23 points, as heightened concerns over slower global economic growth prompted investors to seek refuge in safe havens. The benchmark index inched up 5.94 points or 0.37% to close at 1,630.17 last Friday.Last week’s downward revision of the 2019 global growth forecast by the International Monetary Fund to 3.3% from 3.5% did not help matters. The fund had earlier this year revised down its growth forecast from 3.6%.Nomura head of equity research for Malaysia Tushar Mohata agrees that now is not the right time to turn to defensive stocks.That is because the defensive stocks on Bursa Malaysia have underperformed their Asean counterparts “significantly” due to strong outflows from foreign portfolio investors, he said.According to last Monday’s fund flow report by MIDF Research, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, foreign funds have sold RM1.76 billion net of local equities. Among the four Asean markets (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines) it monitors, Malaysia has now surpassed Thailand to become the nation with the largest foreign net outflow.“Investors may want to consider looking at high beta stocks, which are trading at steep discount to their long-term average trading multiples. The near-term catalysts of these stocks could be improving earnings momentum,” said Tushar.He believes that these high beta stocks are likely to rally when Bursa reverses course and outperforms its peers in Asean.His top picks are CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, Gamuda Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.For investors who want exposure to defensive sectors, Tushar pointed out that real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one due to their stable yield.RHB Research Institute head of Malaysian research Alexander Chia said for domestic investors that need to remain invested in local equities, the preservation of capital will be a key priority.“Adding some defensive names to one’s portfolio continues to make tactical sense, given the prevailing risks that are still unfolding. These companies should have strong earnings resilience that can ride through market upheavals,” he added.Chia is recommending stocks such as Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Mynews Holdings Bhd, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd.However, in the short term, Chia said investors should be aware of the persistent selling by foreign portfolio investors and hence, be wary of stocks with large foreign shareholdings.He also noted that only large-cap stocks have underperformed this year, while small-cap stocks have performed well.YTD, the FBM Small Cap Index has risen 18.29% to close at 13,365.62 points last Friday, while the KLCI has fallen 3.57%.Noting that it is a trading market now, Chia said funds need to make money and achieve alpha or active returns on their investments.“The market is now very short-term and the valuation [of Malaysian stocks] is not that cheap even at current levels,” he added.Hence, he opined that investors should look for pockets of opportunity, beaten down stocks, value buys and undervalued stocks. Silver lining in defensive stocksWhile current market conditions have not been really positive and it is seen that even defensive stocks have been underperforming so far this year, analysts still see some silver lining in defensive stocks.UOB Kay Hian Malaysia research head Vincent Khoo expects defensive stocks to underperform the broader market in the near term, as the government steps up fiscal stimulus activities via megaprojects.This is also to respect the sanctity of government contracts, especially pertaining to its proposed acquisition of Gamuda’s highways, he said.“In such a scenario, we foresee improved investor confidence and foreign equity flows turning positive,” he added.However, there are still some defensive stocks which continue to have modest appeal and these include high dividend yielders such as IGB REIT and Magnum Bhd.Khoo said stocks that will continue to remain attractive include selective beneficiaries of megaprojects and trade diversion.Meanwhile, stocks to avoid include selective glove manufacturers as clarity on demand and supply dynamics is needed; selective technology companies on the back of anticipated weak first quarter of 2019 results season; and Telekom Malaysia Bhd where UOB Kay Hian will need to assess the magnitude of its fall in broadband access average revenue per user.MIDF Research head Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman is of the view that defensive stocks can still be a safe haven when it comes to consumer consumption and dividend play.In relation to consumption, he noted that the distributive trade was still growing at 6.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February, albeit moderating from 7.8% y-o-y in the previous month, due to a shorter month and the festive holidays.Retail growth was 8.5% y-o-y, while wholesale and motor vehicles grew 5.8% y-o-y and 2.4% y-o-y respectively.“This shows consumption remains strong among Malaysians,” said Redza.He said stocks with “still strong earnings”, coupled with stable dividend payments, should also be considered amid these trying times.“Companies with strong earnings would provide a stable flow of future dividends and with market sentiment negatively affecting the price movements, this could present a good opportunity to accumulate stocks with high dividend yields.“So, investors shouldn’t just look at historical dividend payments alone; they also have to look at the defensiveness of the companies’ profits,” he added.MIDF Research is recommending stocks such as DiGi.Com Bhd, MBM Resources Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and UOA Development Bhd.Despite concerns over a potential cut in the overnight policy rate by Bank Negara Malaysia, which may negatively impact banks’ profitability, Redza also likes CIMB and Malayan Banking Bhd, noting that their share prices have fallen a lot over the past year.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/when-defensive-stocks-are-no-longer-bearmarket-safe-haven
"April 09, 2019 11:09 am +08",MAGNUM,Better ticket sales expected for BToto on illegal market crackdown,"Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd
(April 8, RM2.62)
Maintain outperform with a higher target price (TP) of RM2.95: Despite gaining strongly by 25% year to date (YTD), we still see value in Berjaya Sports Toto Bhd (BToto) on potential upticks in ticket sales, mainly driven by the authorities actively clamping down on illegal operators. In fact, sin stocks are in the spotlight as investors search for yielding stocks. Another positive is BToto is the cheapest sin stock with the highest dividend yield among peers. Our “outperform” rating for the stock remains and it’s our top pick for our second quarter of 2019 (2Q19) strategy at a revised TP of RM2.95. 
Last Friday, we met with management for updates concerning ticket sales, which saw upticks in the past two quarters. Management is excited as enforcement against illegal operators, started last September, has resulted in customers switching to licensed operators as rival Magnum Bhd — with an “outperform” rating and TP of RM2.50 — also experienced a similar trend in previous quarters.We understand that illegal operators had evolved to operate in physical shops — the target of enforcement, especially in the Klang Valley. Since then, BToto saw ticket sales for its Classic 4D rising 5% — fairly encouraging. The enforcement is healthy for the number forecast operators (NFOs) as the black market’s size is easily one to two times bigger than the licensed NFOs’ volumes.While the local NFO contributed more than 80% of the group’s pre-tax profit, earnings from Philippine-based Philippine Gaming Management Corp (PGMC) and UK unit HR Owen (HRO) could be volatile. In fact, PGMC’s pre-tax profit fell to RM5.2 million in 3Q19 from RM22.7 million in 2Q19, owing to a lower leased rental income as the contract for the lottery system machine expired last August. As such, in the interim, PGMC continues to receive a lower rental income until a new contract is sorted.Earnings from the super sport cars dealer HRO were fairly volatile previously given the auto sales value coupled with the British pound’s volatility. Meanwhile, its 10.2%-owned Vietnamese NFO firm, Berjaya GTI, is still in the red, although it has operated since mid-2016 and is unlikely to be profitable in the near future given the infant NFO market there.BToto was suppressed in the past five years due to declining ticket sales. However, its fortunes turned when it posted a remarkable YTD gain of 25% largely due to improving ticket sales. We also noticed other sin stocks such as Magnum and brewers Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd — with an “underperform” rating and TP of RM21.80 — and Heineken Malaysia Bhd (“maintain perform”; TP: RM21.90), posting strong YTD gains of 20% to 32% as we believe investors are seeking laggards with defensive qualities and these stocks offer attractive above-average yields.Even with strong gains, BToto remains a laggard as it is the cheapest among these sin stocks, and with the highest dividend yield. It trades at 13 times price-earnings ratio (PER) — only half of brewers’ valuation, while BToto offers above 6% yield against the rest at over 3%. As such, BToto can be a sector catch-up play.In view of the said ticket sales downtrend finally reversing and with better sales ahead on enforcement against the illegal market, we raised our terminal growth from 1% to 2% — the same as Magnum’s, while keeping our key assumptions unchanged, thus we upgraded our TP to RM2.95 from RM2.65 per discounted cash flow (DCF) share.We believe our new TP is not excessive as the counter is still the cheapest sin stock with the highest dividend yield. Our TP also implies a prospective PER of 14.7 times, in line with its three- and five-year means. As such, we kept our “outperform” call, with downside risks including a decline in ticket sales and a higher-than-expected estimated prize payout ratio. — Kenanga Research, April 8",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/better-ticket-sales-expected-btoto-illegal-market-crackdown

Bloomberg data shows that the acquisition was done at 68 sen per share or a total of RM121.09 million. The transaction — done at a significant premium to KUB’s closing price of 39.5 sen on that day — raises some eyebrows given the parties’ perceived connection to Umno.JAG Capital is an investment holding company linked to the family of former finance minister II Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani, whereas Anchorscape is an investment holding company linked to Darhim Dali Hashim and Datuk Abdul Rahman Mohd Redza.Meanwhile, Darhim is a director of Prasarana Malaysia Bhd and CEO of Radimax Group Sdn Bhd, a shipyard, engineering and vessel-building company while Abdul Rahman is Linggi state assemblyman from Umno.Following the shares divestment, Anchorscape remains a substantial shareholder of KUB with a 20.2% stake.

(April 22, RM1)
Maintain add with an unchanged target price of RM1.28: Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 16 (MFRS 16) is a new accounting approach effective Jan 1, 2019 that requires a lessee to recognise its sale-and-leaseback transactions on its balance sheet over the leases’ terms, effectively eliminating off-balance sheet leases. Out of the 26 hospitals under KPJ Healthcare Bhd’s network, 17 hospitals and several other healthcare-related properties are under the operating lease model. This effectively means that KPJ now has to bring back these assets to its balance sheet, on top of its nine currently owned hospitals in Rawang, Pasir Gudang, Bandar Maharani, BDO (Bandar Dato’ Onn), Sri Manjung, Perlis, Pahang, Sabah and Sibu. 
Our calculation reveals that net profit for financial year 2019 (FY19)/FY20/FY21 could be impacted by -10.9%/- 1.5%/-5.5% on a pro forma basis after the adoption of MFRS 16 as we include an increase in interest expense from the operating leases and depreciation of right-of-use assets, and remove the scheduled lease payments due to the lessors from the P&L (profit and loss). Although the accounting adjustments result in weaker earnings forecasts for FY19 to FY21 due to the front-loading of expenses (from interest cost and depreciation of operating assets), it merely affects the classification of cash movements and does not alter the cash flow of the company.We estimate that the net gearing ratio will rise from 0.6 times to 1.2 times for FY19 post MFRS 16 adoption, while the gross gearing ratio will rise to 1.4 times from 0.8 times. We gather that KPJ’s lenders have given the assurance that lease liabilities will not be included in measuring its credit risk. Investors should be comforted that the risk of a breach of the loan covenant (which may result in higher borrowing costs) due to MFRS 16 adjustments is unlikely.We retain our “add” recommendation and remain positive on the group’s expansion plans as they will boost its potential to capture future patient growth. We think the ramp-up in its operations will also offset its start-up losses, and that its patient growth momentum should continue (FY19 forecast: +3.4% year-on-year).Potential rerating catalysts are stronger private healthcare demand, improved earnings from its cost optimisation efforts, and a shorter-than-expected gestation period for its new hospitals. Downside risks are lower-than expected patient volumes, a longer-than-expected gestation period for its new hospitals, and larger-than-expected losses from its new hospitals. — CGSCIMB Research, April 19",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kpj-expansion-plans-expected-boost-patients

Every unit of input injected into the economy is yielding less Gross Domestic Product growth compared with the past,” he said in his speech at the Industry Excellence Awards 2018 here today.To shift to productivity-driven growth, the Prime Minister said, companies should invest in research and development in order to enhance innovation and identify new high value-added products and services.There is also a need to up-skill the labour force and equip them with the latest knowledge and technology, he said.""These concerted efforts are vital to improve labour productivity performance in order to become a developed and inclusive nation. We need to break away from our conventional ‘business as usual’ practices and instead set the country on an accelerated growth trajectory,” Dr Mahathir said.Besides achieving productivity improvements, the Prime Minister cited three other priority areas in which the Government had intensified efforts.They are increasing export capacity to enhance internalisation, improving market efficiency to promote fair competition, and facilitating ease of doing business to improve the business climate.Organised by the Minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the Industry Excellence Awards is aimed at recognising the outstanding companies in Malaysia which have achieved a certain level of excellence in products and services.Tonight's event was also attended by both MITI minister Datuk Darell Leiking and his deputy Dr Ong Kian Ming.The award was presented to eight companies, including Ideal Healthcare Sdn Bhd, Indkom Engineering Sdn Bhd, Excelvite Sdn Bhd, Cita Information Systems Sdn Bhd, Amalgamated Plant Engineering Sdn Bhd, KPJ Ipoh Specialist Hospital and STMicroelectronics Sdn Bhd.KPJ Ipoh Specialist Hospital, meanwhile, clinched the Prime Minister’s Award.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/malaysia-needs-move-productivitydriven-growth-says-pm

Then in June 2017, she joined TMC as CEO of Thomson Hospitals Sdn Bhd.Her appointment is part of a planned succession strategy by TMC’s Singaporean majority shareholder — Singapore Exchange-listed Thomson Medical Group (TMG) — to install strong local leadership in its partner countries.TMG is controlled by Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim, who has numerous business interests including in Spanish football club Valencia.“They [TMG] wanted to localise the operations definitely as with healthcare being a highly regulated business, it is always best to have a local team to drive that.“The mandate given to me from the [major] shareholder is that we must be bold in carving our vision [to be an integrated healthcare provider],” says Nadiah who succeeded Roy Quek Hong Sheng — now CEO and also executive director of TMG. Quek, a Singaporean, was head of TMC from September 2015. Staying relevantPlans are underway for the expansion of THKD, which will see its current capacity of 205 beds triple to 600 by the end of next year, making it one of the largest private hospitals in the Klang Valley.“In healthcare, scale matters, particularly where margins and costs are a big issue. For us, the scale does not mean building a massive chain of hospitals. Unlike other groups, our vision has always been to build an integrated healthcare platform, which is a mix of tertiary hospitals, ambulatory care centres, clinics. We have even ventured into lifestyle and preventive health with our traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacy businesses.“I think it is important not just to have economies of scale but also attract the right talent. If you had a small-scale hospital, you would not be able to attract [the right] talent,” says Nadiah.Meanwhile, work has begun on the construction of the 535-bed Hospital Iskandariah and Thomson Iskandar Medical Hub in Johor Baru.“Piling works for the hospital are expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year, and we expect to award the main building works [then]. If all goes according to plan, it will be completed by 2023,” Nadiah adds.TMC boasts the biggest in vitro fertilisation (IVF) lab in Malaysia, and even made it to The Malaysia Book of Records for the “highest number of IVF babies produced by a single IVF practice” when it registered 5,388 babies in October last year.The accolade aside, this achievement boosted the group’s market share of fertility services in Malaysia to 20%.It also translated into a record fiscal year in 2018, as net profit grew 7% year on year to RM27.8 million on the back of a 11% expansion in revenue to RM169 million.“With the new capacity coming in [from the extension of THKD], we expect to see double-digit growth in both revenue and net profit,” says Nadiah.Even so, in terms of the full suite of healthcare services offered, TMC’s market share is smaller than that of other private healthcare players such as IHH Healthcare Bhd and KPJ Healthcare Bhd.“As a hospital, I would freely admit that our market share is lower than that of our competitors because we are a single hospital. However, I would say that we are doing very well, given our size and full occupancy at the current facility.“Unfortunately, that could sometimes mean (a) pretty long waiting time for our patients,” says Nadiah.THKD also receives droves of medical tourists from Indonesia, China, Myanmar and India.“Indonesian patients come here due to the shortage of doctors [over] there. For patients from China — mainly for fertility reasons — many of them are trying to have babies after the lifting of the one-child policy,” she says, adding that for Indians, the cultural stigma attached to fertility treatments forces many to seek such services abroad.“Around 20% of our patients are international. If it goes up to 30%, that would be good but it is still important to maintain a strong local base.“For example, there was this issue in Singapore where they had too many medical tourists, and the locals started to feel that they were not being taken care of. So in healthcare, there is a socio-political element to it, and we are very much aware of that.”Although the group has seen steady growth in its operations, its tight shareholding structure puts off retail and institutional investors. TMG controls some 70.3% of the group while Johor crown prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim owns 7.66%. According to Bloomberg, TMC’s public float is a mere 17.89%.“We are trying to work on the liquidity issue, but at the same time we cannot divest everything overnight. So as we consider more corporate exercises, probably you will see things like share swaps,” says Nadiah.TMC closed at 74 sen last Thursday, valuing the company at RM1.29 billion. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/fertility-beating-heart-tmcs-growth

(April 10, RM1.02)
Maintain hold with an unchanged sum-of-parts-derived fair value (FV) of RM1.15: KPJ Healthcare’s unit KPJ Tawakkal Specialist Hospital, located along Jalan Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur, plans to construct a new tower block to add 120 beds. The expansion plan is still in the early stage and subject to the ministry of health’s approval. If all goes well, construction is expected to start by the end of financial year 2019 (FY19) and complete by end-FY22. 
KPJ Tawakkal, which currently operates 200 beds, posted a revenue of RM200 million and about RM20 million profit before tax (PBT) in FY18. Its contribution to the groups’ FY18 was about 6% and 7.5% of revenue and PBT respectively.KPJ Tawakkal’s occupancy rate stood at around 70%. The hospital aims to increase its medical tourist patient visits to 15% from the current 7% through its medical tourism initiatives and service offerings.As the hospital expansion is still in its early planning stage, we have not changed our forecasts. However, should the expansion plan go through, it will impact the group in the long term, improving its discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation. A quick calculation estimates its FV to increase to RM1.17 from RM1.15.We maintain our estimate of 13% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation  margin for the group’s forecasted 2019 financial year (FY19F) as we expect gestation costs stemming from its new hospital openings to offset any margin boost from the group’s ongoing cost optimisation and increase in inpatient admissions.KPJ opened KPJ Bandar Datuk Onn in Johor Baru in February and is expected to launch its KPJ Miri, KPJ Kuching and KPJ Batu Pahat hospitals in the second half of FY19 (2HFY19).We like KPJ Healthcare for its vast network of hospitals in Malaysia, capacity expansion and its position to benefit from the national health insurance scheme. However, we believe at its current share price, the stock is close to its full valuation. At our FV of RM1.15 a share, the implied price to earnings is 23.8 times. — AmInvestment Bank, April 10",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/new-hospitals-likely-boost-kpj-healthcare-earnings

"April 01, 2019 16:00 pm +08",KPJ,Cover Story: Building a sense of neighbourliness,"A chance meeting could change one’s life. For Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd group executive director Datuk Robert Tan Kim Kuan, the serendipitous event occurred when he first arrived at Universiti Malaya in the early 1970s.“In those days, there was no professional career guidance. I only knew the professions of teaching, medicine and law enforcement,” Robert recalls with a smile. “Being a doctor or policeman was out, so I signed up at the science faculty in Universiti Malaya [to be a teacher]. After that, a friend of mine looked at my results and said why don’t I try engineering?“I asked him what an engineer did and he explained it to me. He said engineers construct houses for people to stay in and build roads to get people from one point to another; which I considered noble work. So, instead of going to the science faculty, I went to the engineering faculty. I changed my major and it was God’s guidance.”Robert graduated in 1974 with a degree in civil engineering and started his career in the government sector. After 2½ years, he moved to a consultancy and stayed a further 2½ years before joining YTL Construction, where he rose through the ranks to become chief engineer.In 1990, with a young family, he decided to strike out on his own and founded Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd. “After 14 years of working for people, I felt I was ready to start my own company. First, I wanted to challenge myself to see how much I could do and, second, I needed more money to feed my family,” he says with a chuckle. “I set up Temokin Holdings with a capital of RM35,000. We then got three Tenaga Nasional substation projects. We did earthworks for Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor (PKNS), a highway in Klang for Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia and a sewage project for PKNS.”The company continued to do well in the 1990s and survived the Asian financial crisis. “In 1997, when the crisis came, I bought a RM2 million microtunnelling machine from Japan. I got two projects, which was more than enough to cover my cost,” says Robert. The mix of private and government projects involved companies such as Dialog Group Bhd, Puncak Niaga Holdings Bhd and Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur. Microtunnelling, also called pipe jacking, uses smaller drills to build underground pipelines, ducts and culverts.Two of his four children — three boys and a girl — became engineers. One of them is his youngest son, Chien Chyi, who is the director of the company’s property development division, Temokin Development Sdn Bhd. “I took up engineering because I had grown up going to work sites and construction sites. I think that exposure showcased that engineering is a good foundation,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do pure engineering, so I moved into property development, which is a natural progression from engineering.”Robert agrees with his son and believes that the communal element of construction marries well with property development. “Construction is very communal. We construct roads for people to go from one point to another, we construct bridges for people to cross rivers, flyovers to ease traffic congestion and channels to supply water to households. We help deal with sewage before it goes into the rivers,” he explains.The move into property development was always a goal for Robert but he held back until 2011, when he incorporated Temokin Development. “When I was in the construction industry, I already had plans to go into property development. I started by buying pieces of land first.”He bided his time until his children had graduated and he encouraged them to work in the family company. “For a company to continue, you must inject new and young blood to make it vibrant. I decided to start the property development division but we took two to three years to learn about the industry before launching our first project.”Products that create a communityTemokin Development wants to come up with products that help create a community feeling through greater engagement. Placemaking — the approach of planning, designing and managing public spaces for the wellbeing of stakeholders — is an integral part of this vision.“We always operate from our group values of ‘WE DIG’, where W is wisdom, E is equality, D is diligence, I is integrity and G is guidance. So with all this, it sparks a communal aspect in our DNA. We want to be a community-based property developer,” says Chien Chyi.Temokin Development’s maiden project — the freehold Mahligai in Nusa Damai, Pasir Gudang, Johor — sits on 11.5 acres and has a gross development value (GDV) of RM100 million. The land was purchased in 2014 for RM10 million or RM35.80 psf.“The surrounding areas are developed and mature. Somehow, the owner of the land, a developer, decided to sell it,” explains Robert.“We named our maiden project Mahligai because the word is Sanskrit for ‘mansion’ and we believe that anyone who buys our product will be able to come home to and enjoy their own mansion,” says Chien Chyi.Robert adds, “Mahligai is also a Malay word. I asked my Malay business partner, who said, to him, it means ‘heaven’. And in heaven, you get peace. So I said ‘Okay, we will go with this name [for our first project].”The development is divided into three phases, says Chien Chyi. “We are launching the development in phases so that we can develop something better [in each phase], to give our buyers a better product. From Phase 1, we collected feedback from buyers, and we have incorporated them into the design of Phase 2.“The target market is Johoreans, a localised market, and first-time homebuyers. The product is uniquely priced and very strategically located. We’re happy to say that 80% of Phase 1, which we launched last year, has been taken up and most of the buyers were within our target market,” he says.Launched last Sept 25, Phase 1 consists of 53 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,679 to 1,752 sq ft were priced from RM562,000, or RM368 psf on average. The targeted handover is April 2020.Phase 2, scheduled to be launched next month, features 87 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,759 to 1,802 sq ft will have indicative prices starting from RM593,000, or RM393 psf on average.“For security, we have incorporated a guardhouse and are seeking approval from the local council to fence up certain areas to prevent outsiders from entering,” says Chien Chyi.Mahligai will boast of three parks — two larger parks and a pocket park — for residents to enjoy. To create a sense of ownership of these green spaces, Temokin Development has embarked on a placemaking initiative called Kita Bersama. One of its first engagement activities is to gather views from future residents of Mahligai — buyers of Phase 1 as well as prospective buyers — of what they would like to see incorporated in the larger parks, after which a vote will be taken.The pocket park will be landscaped by the developer as it is a small plot. “This is not a strata development but one with individual titles. So we wanted to give the buyers and the local council easy-to-maintain but effective landscaping and practical green space,” says Chien Chyi.After the 11.5 acres are fully developed, the common spaces will be handed over to the local authorities to maintain.No launch date has been set for the last phase but Chien Chyi reveals that the homes will be larger at three storeys and have direct access to the green spaces.The development is accessible via the Pasir Gudang Highway and Senai-Desaru Expressway. Education centres in the vicinity include Sultan Ibrahim Premier Polytechnic Johor Bahru, Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Industrial Technology, UniWorld International School and The Japanese School of Johor. Mydin, Tesco and Maslee Pasir Gudang Supermarket among others will cater for residents’ grocery and other household needs. KPJ Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital, Penawar Hospital and Regency Specialist Hospital are also nearby.Developing a presence in the Klang ValleyThe Tans will incorporate their placemaking initiatives in future developments. While it is a good idea, will it be possible to replicate it in other places as it requires plenty of engagement and planning?The Tans are up to the challenge. “Doing something like this [placemaking] isn’t easy. Building highways, tall buildings and so on is not easy. From a construction point of view, nothing is easy,” Chien Chyi says. “So, mirroring that in development, there are so many factors that are not easy. But we want to strive and engage in [placemaking] because we are a people-centric community developer. In whatever development we do, we want to embrace that factor.”Currently, the developer has a land bank of 50 acres, which is spread over the central region of Peninsular Malaysia.“We are launching a project this year in Taman Melati, Gombak — a freehold development on 2.2 acres. We are looking to build 24 landed superlink homes. Built on Malay Reserve land, the houses will be 24ft by 123ft with a built-up of 3,000 sq ft,” says Chien Chyi.“The key aspect is that 12 units will have a dual-key concept. This is because of the maturity of the area and the project’s location near the Gombak LRT station. We’ve found that there is potential capital appreciation for homeowners who want to rent out their second space or keep it for a family member.”The selling price is yet to be set but the estimated GDV is RM40 million. The Tans plan to launch the project in 2H2019.Also in the pipeline is a joint-venture project with Tropicana Corp Bhd on a 2.28-acre freehold parcel located near 3 Damansara in Petaling Jaya. The JV, which will most likely feature a high-rise block, was signed on Sept 27 last year.For now, Temokin Development’s focus will be on the central and southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia and it will bide its time to develop its remaining land bank to ensure that it meets the needs of the market.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-building-sense-neighbourliness

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium
"April 12, 2019 08:49 am +08",POS,DRB-Hicom at inflection point,"KUALA LUMPUR: DRB-Hicom Bhd is shaping up as far as its managing director (MD) Datuk Seri Syed Faisal Albar is concerned.His confidence mainly hinges on the turnaround of its biggest loss-maker, namely the 50.1%-owned subsidiary Proton Holdings Bhd, although some analysts remain cautious about the carmaker.“Obviously, we have the numbers already, but we are bound by listing requirements. It (the fourth financial quarter ended March 31, 2019) [4QFY19] is better than (the) December (quarter) numbers, that’s all I can say,” Syed Faisal told the press during the media trip to the group’s Composites Technology Research Malaysia Sdn Bhd manufacturing plant in Melaka.For current financial year ending March 31, 2020 (FY20), as long as Proton’s financial health remains sound, Syed Faisal said he expects more financial improvement moving forward.Since the launch of Proton’s sport utility vehicle (SUV) X70 on Dec 12 last year, DRB-Hicom’s share price has gained 13.2% to close at RM2.14 yesterday, valuing the group at RM4.14 billion. Within the first 100 days after the launch of the X70, Proton Holdings has already sold and delivered 8,500 units.“The numbers are getting better, because of Proton’s health, which is getting healthier, and we are going to launch the new facelift for the Iriz and Persona models very soon.“It has been (in) choppy (waters) previously, a lot of it rests on Proton. And Proton is showing signs of turning around, so as long as that is being maintained, we will see more improvements,” he said.DRB-Hicom reported a net profit of RM73.02 million for 3QFY19 against a net loss of RM70.03 million a year ago while revenue grew 9.3% to RM3.17 billion versus RM2.9 billion a year ago, due to higher sales from Proton and other automotive brands, and higher contribution from 70%-owned Bank Muamalat and Alam Flora Sdn Bhd, but partially offset by lower contribution from the property division. However, for the cumulative nine months ended Dec 31, 2018 (9MFY19), the group posted a net loss of RM5 million against a net profit of RM489.77 million the year before.As Proton’s financial health improves, Syed Faisal said banks will be more confident in DRB-Hicom. Struggles in Pos MalaysiaNonetheless, as Proton’s performance improved, DRB-Hicom’s nother core subsidiary — Pos Malaysia Bhd, in which it holds a 53.5% stake — is facing a tough time. The postal group incurred a net loss of RM24.62 million over 9MFY19, on revenue of RM1.76 billion, which was 3.2% lower than RM1.82 billion a year ago.Syed Faisal said the struggle in Pos Malaysia is mainly due to the cap on postal tariff, which is dictated by the government.“Pos Malaysia is all about the tariff increases,” said Syed Faisal. There was only one hike in postal tariff since 1992. The hike was granted in 2010 when Syed Faisal was the chief executive officer of Pos Malaysia.“It has been almost 10 years now, (and) there has not been any increase,” said Syed Faisal, noting that it is due for a hike on postal tariff.Other than fixed costs, Syed Faisal also said operating costs are high for Pos Malaysia, especially to provide rural air courier to fulfil social obligations. “We know there are costs, and the government also understands, so we are waiting for the government to make a decision [on reviewing postal tariff],” he said, but declined to elaborate on the quantum of increase that DRB-Hicom is expecting. Alam Flora divestment intact despite hiccupsDRB-Hicom’s plan to dispose of Alam Flora Sdn Bhd to Malakoff Bhd remains intact despite more time being required to fulfil the regulatory requirements.In March, the group told Bursa Malaysia that both parties had mutually agreed to extend the period to fulfil certain conditions for the disposal by another six months to Sept 8, which originally expired six months from Aug 1, 2018, when the share sales agreement was signed.The divestment is crucial as the sale proceeds of RM944.61 million raised will be utilised for debt repayment and the capital expenditure requirement for Proton Holdings. DRB-Hicom is expected to make an estimated disposal gain of RM735.4 million.“(Regarding) Alam Flora, we are still in discussions with the government, because they want to see details, to get their approval ... but this has gone through shareholders, (and) they approved, (so) we are targeting to complete by the end of the year,” he said.

"April 01, 2019 08:51 am +08",POS,Will Proton X70 steer DRB-Hicom onto recovery path?,"KUALA LUMPUR: Within the first 100 days after the launch of its sport utility vehicle (SUV), X70, Proton Holdings Bhd has already sold and delivered 8,500 units.According to Proton, X70 is the most popular SUV in town now by sales volume. Simply put, it might have been a long while that Proton has such brisk sales of its vehicles.For that, it would be interesting to watch whether Proton manages to steer its controlling shareholder DRB-Hicom Bhd, which has been dragged into big losses by the car manufacturer, onto the road to recovery soon.DRB-Hicom currently holds a 50.1% stake in Proton after the diversified group, controlled by tycoon Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, sold a 49.9% stake to Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.Few would disagree that the sale number paints a positive picture of Proton ahead. However, most fund managers and analysts hold a more conservative view on DRB-Hicom.Speaking to The Edge, Fortress Capital Management director Geoffrey Ng said it is still too early to conclude that if the X70 sales are an indication Proton is on the path to return to its heyday partly because profit margins on a unit basis are not known.“This being Geely’s first co-produced car with Proton, it could be an aggressively-priced car to regain public interest. From a financial perspective we really don’t know how this contributes to Proton’s recovery in terms of profitability,” Ng said.Furthermore, he said the number of new models Proton could feasibly introduce into the domestic passenger car market is unclear given the current soft market condition.There was only a 2.3% growth in total industry volume in 2018 to 590,000 units, from 576,635 vehicles in 2017. And the growth was fuelled by the tax holiday between June to August last year after the removal of the goods and services tax and before the implementation of the sales and services tax.On the other hand, the more optimistic one see that the strong sales would at least help lift the utilisation rate of Proton’s plant in Tanjung Malim, which is currently believed to be at below 50%.“If they can keep the momentum from their first model, the X70, it should help to ramp up their production in their Tanjung Malim plant,” said an analyst who had DRB-Hicom on his watch list.When asked if he sees Proton breaking even any time soon, the analyst said DRB-Hicom had indicated that Proton would reach the break-even point this year.However, some commented that is too optimistic.Diversified portfolioProton is DRB-Hicom’s biggest loss-maker. Any improvements in the carmaker’s sales and earnings would to a large extent boost DRB-Hicom’s bottom line.“We are still positive on DRB-Hicom because we expect the group to narrow its losses this year and next year,” said the analyst, expecting DRB-Hicom to be in the black within two to three years.For the nine months ended Dec 31, 2018 (9MFY19), the group posted a cumulative loss of RM5 million, from RM489.77 million a year earlier.However, DRB-Hicom posted a net profit of RM73.02 million for the third quarter ended Dec 31, 2018 (3QFY19) compared to a net loss of RM70.03 million for the previous corresponding quarter. The profit was boosted by a 22% increase in its automotive-segment revenue.The improved revenue was in part driven by higher sales of Proton make cars and cars from its defence segment.DRB-Hicom owns a 55.92% stake in Pos Malaysia. When Proton was pulling DRB-Hicom into deeper losses, Pos Malaysia then helped mitigate the losses.Nonetheless, the postal group has slipped into the red for two consecutive quarters. It posted a net loss of RM24.6 million for the nine months ended Dec 31, 2018 compared to a net profit of RM62.4 million a year ago. While there is hope Proton might soon stop the bleeding of DRB-Hicom, the losses at Pos Malaysia, however, raise concern it may drag down the diversified group.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/will-proton-x70-steer-drbhicom-recovery-path

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium

Data compiled by Forbes showed that of the 50 richest persons in the country, 30 saw their wealth shrink. Only 11 recorded gains.Sugar baron Robert Kuok, who for the past 23 years has held pole position as Malaysia’s richest person, saw the greatest dissipation of wealth in absolute terms. His US$2 billion (RM8.18 billion) loss in net worth was more than double the next biggest decline of US$900 million suffered byT Ananda Krishnan.Indeed, Public Bank Bhd icon Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow overtook Ananda, whose net worth was hit by the sharp share price fall in his listed companies, pay-TV operator Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd and telcommunications company Maxis Bhd, in the second half of 2018.However, Kuok’s total net worth of US$12.8 billion still outstrips the second richest Malaysian, Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan of the Hong Leong Malaysia Group, whose fortune grew by an impressive US$2.2 billion to US$9.4 billion from US$7.2 billion a year ago.Some US$600 million was also wiped off from the net worth of YTL Group’s Tan Sri Francis Yeoh and his siblings (see table).But in percentage terms, the biggest loser among Malaysia’s top 50 richest was Wong Thean Soon whose net worth plunged 63% to US$280 million following Barisan Nasional’s shock defeat in the 14th general election last year, dragging his company My EG Services Bhd (MyEG) to a four-year low.Wong — the second largest shareholder and managing director of the e-government services provider — was left US$475 million poorer, falling 29 places to 48th position, according to Forbes.Chairperson Datuk Norraesah Mohamad — MyEG’s largest shareholder and the only woman on the list last year — dropped off this year’s top 50.Forbes also highlighted the losses incurred by Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, although he retained his position as the 12th richest person in Malaysia. The tycoon, who controls stakes in MMC Corp Bhd, DRB-Hicom Bhd and Pos Malaysia Bhd, among others, saw a US$200 million erosion to his net worth last year as mega-infrastructure projects were put on hold pending ongoing reviews.For casino king Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, not only was his flagship Genting Bhd caught in a legal spat with former US partners 20th Century Fox and Disney over a planned theme park in Genting Highlands, but its listed unit Genting Malaysia Bhd succumbed to its biggest quarterly loss of RM1.5 billion in the third financial quarter due to an impairment on Genting’s investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, US.In an article yesterday, Forbes attributed the wealth decline of Malaysia’s richest to a slowing economic growth rate and an 8% decline in the FBM KLCI over the last eight months.The significant depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar was another factor.However, even though six out of 10 of Malaysia’s richest tycoons experienced a drop in net worth, they remain the 10 wealthiest men in the country as at March 2019.Kuok controls the Shangri-La and Kerry group via Hong Kong-listed entities, as well as Singapore’s Wilmar International Ltd and Malaysia’s PPB Group Bhd.The compilation of data was based on stock prices and exchange rates as of Feb 28, and sourced from stock exchanges, government agencies such as the Companies Commission of Malaysia, analysts, private databases and the individuals, said Forbes.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/richest-malaysians-saw-large-dissipation-wealth-2018

We really hope that more facilities are put in place so that the terminal becomes more vibrant,” he said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kuching-international-airport-have-new-cargo-complex

"March 08, 2019 11:30 am +08",POS,Business Of Sports: Bridge Too Far For Roman Abramovich?,"The owner has not been seen all season. The manager is a dead man walking. The stadium plans have been shelved, young stars want to leave and the team is struggling in the league. The club faces a two-window transfer ban and the goalkeeper — the world’s most expensive — has staged an on-field mutiny. Cynics say it is “situation normal” at the London-based Chelsea football club.But from whichever vantage point — yacht or penthouse or Bond villain bolthole — Roman Abramovich happens to be viewing recent events, it is not how he envisaged they would unfold in his 16th year as the Blues’ saviour and great panjandrum. Indeed, they may have reaffirmed his decision to sell up. He has already turned down £2 billion but would take a £3 billion offer.Football’s most famous owner bought Chelsea on a whim — 10 minutes into the first match he had ever seen in the flesh. It was one of those magical European nights — a seven-goal thriller between two storied clubs, Manchester United and Real Madrid — but the Russian billionaire had not even needed a goal: he was already spellbound by the atmosphere. With the game still scoreless, he turned to his companions and, visibly enraptured by the spectacle, told them, “I want to buy a club.”He settled on Chelsea mainly for their prestigious West End location. Nearly bankrupt, the club was also going for a song — a mere £140 million. The deal was done in 20 minutes and he proceeded to spend like there was no tomorrow.For a while, it was every fan’s fantasy as big names were delivered as if by Pos Laju along with a dynamic young manager in Jose Mourinho. And the trophies rolled in as surely as night follows day.Whenever there was a blip, Abramovich’s remedy was to sack the manager — Mourinho twice — but despite the door to that office almost coming off its hinges, there were few fallow years. The successes saw “Chelski” join the elite of Europe’s fully paid-up super clubs.But unlike Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who took over Manchester City five years later with a grand plan and with whom he is often compared, Abramovich seems to make it up as he goes along. He wanted Chelsea to play like Barcelona and tried to woo Pep Guardiola, but the Catalan ended up at City instead.He built an expensive training ground and wanted a bigger stadium so that the club would be self-sufficient one day. But both projects have backfired. Despite hundreds of wonder kids arriving from around the globe, not one has established himself in the first team. The last academy grad to do so was locally born John Terry — while Abramovich was still helping himself to Soviet oil riches.Now Chelsea have been banned from signing anybody because they breached Fifa rules for recruiting underage players. Currently, no fewer than 41 Chelsea youngsters and older fringe players are currently “parked” around Europe. The club will appeal.Never satisfied with the cramped confines of Stamford Bridge, Abramovich spent a fruitless decade searching for an alternative home. After getting outbid by a Malaysian consortium of Sime Darby Bhd, S P Setia Bhd and the Employees Provident Fund for the iconic site of Battersea Power Station, he decided to stay put.He came up with a stunning new design for a futuristic £1 billion Stamford Bridge but problems with planning permission and finding a suitable temporary home for three seasons drove him to well-documented distraction.All in all, he has spent almost as much as the sheikh (circa £1.5 billion) but as business models for football club ownership go, the two Blues are at opposite ends of the spectrum.Where Abu Dhabi’s is about soft power and planning for when the oil runs out, the Russian’s is about having fun — and a bolthole in a Western country. And sure enough, his style is more Donald Trump than Leon Trotsky: Chelsea’s state of “permanent revolution” is because he fires managers as if they are contestants on The Apprentice.Even those who have just won silverware are not safe. The Holy Grail of the Champions League (plus FA Cup) bought Roberto di Matteo a mere six months while Carlo Ancelotti was out a season after winning the domestic double. Luiz Felipe Scolari won a World Cup for Brazil but lasted only seven months.The current life expectancy of a Chelsea manager is around a season — there have been 15 (including caretakers) and 15 trophies have been won. If Abramovich does end current boss Maurizio Sarri’s reign soon, the Russian will reach an unwanted century — in millions of compensation pounds to former managers. But the cost does not stop there: A new man will demand a fresh outlay on players as well as his own backroom staff.Even a director of football could not stop the carnage. But Michael Emenalo, who somehow survived for six years, only served to highlight the madness. A trio of players that he brought in for a combined £33 million were let go for little more only to be resold by their new clubs later for a total of £160 million. Now household names, Kevin de Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and Mo Salah are flourishing at three of the Blues’ main rivals.Had they remained along with star man Eden Hazard, who cost £32 million, and the youngsters Sarri is reluctant to pick, they could have formed the best team Chelsea never had. Not only would it have been the equal of today’s side on paper, it would have cost less than what has been paid to discarded managers.Many of those were victims of player power whose ultimate manifestation was seen on Feb 24 with a goalkeeper defying Sarri’s orders and staying on the field. Senior players have exploited gaping holes in the executive structure — with posts such as chief executive and director of football filled only intermittently — but nothing like this.Now there is an even greater void — at the top. When the British government delayed renewing Abramovich’s work visa after a row with Russia over the Spygate poisoning scandal, it meant he could not even enter the country in his capacity as club chairman. He promptly mothballed the stadium plans which, after the gradual belt-tightening of recent years, led many to believe that he is losing interest in his pet project.But amid the relative austerity, there have been splurges. Like a dieter suddenly going on a binge, Chelsea paid a world record £72 million for the same insubordinate Spanish goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, and then promising Dortmund striker Christian Pulisic for £57 million, who joins next season.In contrast, City look unified and all-conquering, and it is they who play more like Barcelona with a former Barcelona manager, the same Pep Guardiola, holding the reins.As Abramovich and a global audience watched the drama unfold at the Carabao Cup final on Feb 24, the contrast with the unity of City seemed stark. The winning margin was the narrowest possible — on penalties — but between the two clubs there is a gulf. Two weeks earlier, City humiliated Chelsea 6-0 in the league.Where they have secured the first leg of what would be an unprecedented quadruple, Chelsea have to quell a mutiny. The spin doctors tried to say it was a misunderstanding but you hope the watching owner would not be fooled. Sarri was not the only one who has been unable to impose his authority — leadership in absentia is no leadership at all.Bob Holmes is a long-time sports writer specialising in football",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/business-sports-bridge-too-far-roman-abramovich

The YTL-THP JV was selected for the southern portion of the alignment (Johor portion) and MRCB-Gamuda for the northern portion (KL to state border of Melaka-Johor). Moreover, previously reported contenders for the now deferred HSR project were Gamuda, IJM and Naza’s respective consortiums.YTL is backed by a solid track record given its involvement in the construction and operation of the RM2.4 billion Express Rail Link project which was also one of the cheapest that has been rolled out nearly two decades ago at just RM42 million per km.YTL’s order book is estimated at approximately RM8 billion comprising mainly the Gemas-Johor Baru double-tracking project which was not impacted by the Pakatan Harapan government’s review of infrastructure projects in the past eight months. The construction of YTL Power’s Tanjung Jati coal-powered plant in Indonesia was supposed to add an estimated RM4 billion, but progress on the financial close of this project has been delayed, presumably given the upcoming Indonesian elections.A potential revival of the HSR project is a catalyst for YTL’s construction division (construction currently accounts for 3% of group pretax earnings), while construction earnings has seen progressive improvement in recent quarters given progress in the Gemas-JB double tracking project. A drag however, comes from weak Power Seraya performance given the continued overcapacity situation in Singapore power generation. Hyflux’ woes could be a blessing in disguise as it could mean the elimination of excess capacity should there be a dismantling of gas supply agreements to Hyflux’ plants as part of its restructuring, if any. Other than Singapore power, there continues to be concerns surrounding the 1Bestari project, expected to expire in the middle of the calendar year 2019 (CY19), which will be retendered out.We maintain our “neutral” call on YTL for the meantime at an unchanged TP of RM1.15 a share. Key catalysts for a review of our call: i) progress in Tanjung Jati power plant project; ii) improvement in Seraya earnings; and iii) potential revival of the HSR project. — MIDF Research, April 10",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ytl-likely-be-winner-if-hsr-project-revived
"April 03, 2019 08:42 am +08",YTL,Kenanga Research downgrades utilities sector to Neutral ,"KUALA LUMPUR (April 3): Kenanga IB Research has downgraded the utilities sector to “Neutral” and said it has been bullish on the sector given the resilient earnings, but this has come to an end following lower earnings return under the new phases of regulated periods for Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Petronas Gas Bhd while gas Malaysia Bhd may see lower asset return for new RP2 period next year.In a note today, the research house said meanwhile, two IPPs (YTL Power and Malakoff) are still waiting for new earnings stream to fill up income gap, which may not happen in the near term.It said going forward, government’s commitment towards ICPT mechanism is a key factor.“However, the continuation of surcharge after the KWIE fund will be fully utilised, likely in 2020, a key critical factor.“As such, we are downgrading the Utilities Sector to Neutral from Overweight. However, Pestech International Bhd is still an alternative small cap play,” it said.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kenanga-research-downgrades-utilities-sector-neutral
"April 01, 2019 16:00 pm +08",YTL,Cover Story: Building a sense of neighbourliness,"A chance meeting could change one’s life. For Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd group executive director Datuk Robert Tan Kim Kuan, the serendipitous event occurred when he first arrived at Universiti Malaya in the early 1970s.“In those days, there was no professional career guidance. I only knew the professions of teaching, medicine and law enforcement,” Robert recalls with a smile. “Being a doctor or policeman was out, so I signed up at the science faculty in Universiti Malaya [to be a teacher]. After that, a friend of mine looked at my results and said why don’t I try engineering?“I asked him what an engineer did and he explained it to me. He said engineers construct houses for people to stay in and build roads to get people from one point to another; which I considered noble work. So, instead of going to the science faculty, I went to the engineering faculty. I changed my major and it was God’s guidance.”Robert graduated in 1974 with a degree in civil engineering and started his career in the government sector. After 2½ years, he moved to a consultancy and stayed a further 2½ years before joining YTL Construction, where he rose through the ranks to become chief engineer.In 1990, with a young family, he decided to strike out on his own and founded Temokin Holdings Sdn Bhd. “After 14 years of working for people, I felt I was ready to start my own company. First, I wanted to challenge myself to see how much I could do and, second, I needed more money to feed my family,” he says with a chuckle. “I set up Temokin Holdings with a capital of RM35,000. We then got three Tenaga Nasional substation projects. We did earthworks for Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor (PKNS), a highway in Klang for Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia and a sewage project for PKNS.”The company continued to do well in the 1990s and survived the Asian financial crisis. “In 1997, when the crisis came, I bought a RM2 million microtunnelling machine from Japan. I got two projects, which was more than enough to cover my cost,” says Robert. The mix of private and government projects involved companies such as Dialog Group Bhd, Puncak Niaga Holdings Bhd and Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur. Microtunnelling, also called pipe jacking, uses smaller drills to build underground pipelines, ducts and culverts.Two of his four children — three boys and a girl — became engineers. One of them is his youngest son, Chien Chyi, who is the director of the company’s property development division, Temokin Development Sdn Bhd. “I took up engineering because I had grown up going to work sites and construction sites. I think that exposure showcased that engineering is a good foundation,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do pure engineering, so I moved into property development, which is a natural progression from engineering.”Robert agrees with his son and believes that the communal element of construction marries well with property development. “Construction is very communal. We construct roads for people to go from one point to another, we construct bridges for people to cross rivers, flyovers to ease traffic congestion and channels to supply water to households. We help deal with sewage before it goes into the rivers,” he explains.The move into property development was always a goal for Robert but he held back until 2011, when he incorporated Temokin Development. “When I was in the construction industry, I already had plans to go into property development. I started by buying pieces of land first.”He bided his time until his children had graduated and he encouraged them to work in the family company. “For a company to continue, you must inject new and young blood to make it vibrant. I decided to start the property development division but we took two to three years to learn about the industry before launching our first project.”Products that create a communityTemokin Development wants to come up with products that help create a community feeling through greater engagement. Placemaking — the approach of planning, designing and managing public spaces for the wellbeing of stakeholders — is an integral part of this vision.“We always operate from our group values of ‘WE DIG’, where W is wisdom, E is equality, D is diligence, I is integrity and G is guidance. So with all this, it sparks a communal aspect in our DNA. We want to be a community-based property developer,” says Chien Chyi.Temokin Development’s maiden project — the freehold Mahligai in Nusa Damai, Pasir Gudang, Johor — sits on 11.5 acres and has a gross development value (GDV) of RM100 million. The land was purchased in 2014 for RM10 million or RM35.80 psf.“The surrounding areas are developed and mature. Somehow, the owner of the land, a developer, decided to sell it,” explains Robert.“We named our maiden project Mahligai because the word is Sanskrit for ‘mansion’ and we believe that anyone who buys our product will be able to come home to and enjoy their own mansion,” says Chien Chyi.Robert adds, “Mahligai is also a Malay word. I asked my Malay business partner, who said, to him, it means ‘heaven’. And in heaven, you get peace. So I said ‘Okay, we will go with this name [for our first project].”The development is divided into three phases, says Chien Chyi. “We are launching the development in phases so that we can develop something better [in each phase], to give our buyers a better product. From Phase 1, we collected feedback from buyers, and we have incorporated them into the design of Phase 2.“The target market is Johoreans, a localised market, and first-time homebuyers. The product is uniquely priced and very strategically located. We’re happy to say that 80% of Phase 1, which we launched last year, has been taken up and most of the buyers were within our target market,” he says.Launched last Sept 25, Phase 1 consists of 53 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,679 to 1,752 sq ft were priced from RM562,000, or RM368 psf on average. The targeted handover is April 2020.Phase 2, scheduled to be launched next month, features 87 two-storey terraced houses. The 20ft by 70ft homes with built-ups of 1,759 to 1,802 sq ft will have indicative prices starting from RM593,000, or RM393 psf on average.“For security, we have incorporated a guardhouse and are seeking approval from the local council to fence up certain areas to prevent outsiders from entering,” says Chien Chyi.Mahligai will boast of three parks — two larger parks and a pocket park — for residents to enjoy. To create a sense of ownership of these green spaces, Temokin Development has embarked on a placemaking initiative called Kita Bersama. One of its first engagement activities is to gather views from future residents of Mahligai — buyers of Phase 1 as well as prospective buyers — of what they would like to see incorporated in the larger parks, after which a vote will be taken.The pocket park will be landscaped by the developer as it is a small plot. “This is not a strata development but one with individual titles. So we wanted to give the buyers and the local council easy-to-maintain but effective landscaping and practical green space,” says Chien Chyi.After the 11.5 acres are fully developed, the common spaces will be handed over to the local authorities to maintain.No launch date has been set for the last phase but Chien Chyi reveals that the homes will be larger at three storeys and have direct access to the green spaces.The development is accessible via the Pasir Gudang Highway and Senai-Desaru Expressway. Education centres in the vicinity include Sultan Ibrahim Premier Polytechnic Johor Bahru, Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Industrial Technology, UniWorld International School and The Japanese School of Johor. Mydin, Tesco and Maslee Pasir Gudang Supermarket among others will cater for residents’ grocery and other household needs. KPJ Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital, Penawar Hospital and Regency Specialist Hospital are also nearby.Developing a presence in the Klang ValleyThe Tans will incorporate their placemaking initiatives in future developments. While it is a good idea, will it be possible to replicate it in other places as it requires plenty of engagement and planning?The Tans are up to the challenge. “Doing something like this [placemaking] isn’t easy. Building highways, tall buildings and so on is not easy. From a construction point of view, nothing is easy,” Chien Chyi says. “So, mirroring that in development, there are so many factors that are not easy. But we want to strive and engage in [placemaking] because we are a people-centric community developer. In whatever development we do, we want to embrace that factor.”Currently, the developer has a land bank of 50 acres, which is spread over the central region of Peninsular Malaysia.“We are launching a project this year in Taman Melati, Gombak — a freehold development on 2.2 acres. We are looking to build 24 landed superlink homes. Built on Malay Reserve land, the houses will be 24ft by 123ft with a built-up of 3,000 sq ft,” says Chien Chyi.“The key aspect is that 12 units will have a dual-key concept. This is because of the maturity of the area and the project’s location near the Gombak LRT station. We’ve found that there is potential capital appreciation for homeowners who want to rent out their second space or keep it for a family member.”The selling price is yet to be set but the estimated GDV is RM40 million. The Tans plan to launch the project in 2H2019.Also in the pipeline is a joint-venture project with Tropicana Corp Bhd on a 2.28-acre freehold parcel located near 3 Damansara in Petaling Jaya. The JV, which will most likely feature a high-rise block, was signed on Sept 27 last year.For now, Temokin Development’s focus will be on the central and southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia and it will bide its time to develop its remaining land bank to ensure that it meets the needs of the market.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-building-sense-neighbourliness

"March 18, 2019 14:00 pm +08",YTL,Lead Story: Malaysia not alone in ramp-up of share buybacks,"MALAYSIA-listed companies jumped on the share buyback bandwagon last year amid the sharp decline in the local stock market following uncertainties brought about by a historic change in government, as well as trade tensions between the US and China.Last year, share buybacks totalled RM1.56 billion — about six times the RM264 million expended in 2017. The number of companies that utilised the strategy last year also more than doubled to 23, compared with only 10 in the preceding year that bought back more than 2% of their outstanding shares.Among the corporates that spent heavily on share repurchases last year were YTL Power International Bhd, YTL Corp Bhd, Genting Malaysia Bhd, MyEG Services Bhd and Malakoff Corp Bhd.They had seen a sharp decline in their share price during the buyback period. YTL Power, YTL Corp and Genting Malaysia lost 32.2%, 23.5% and 44.4% respectively, while MyEG shed a whopping 56%.Malakoff’s decline was less steep at 13.1%.According to Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of research Vincent Lau, the share buybacks were reflective of market conditions last year as most companies were impacted by external uncertainties.“Most of the buybacks were done because of the sharp selldown in the stock market following some of the external shocks that hit the market … The future direction of the companies is intact and the decline in their share prices had led to the stocks selling for less than their intrinsic value. It creates an opportunity for the companies to buy back some of their shares at a significant discount,” Lau tells The Edge.He believes these activities are positive as they help to stabilise the market in a volatile environment, as seen last year.Lau, however, stresses that it is important for investors to ensure that the companies that buy back their shares on the open market have a healthy cash flow, and do not need to tap borrowings for that purpose.Malaysia was not alone in the ramp-up of share buybacks last year.In the US, companies that normally repatriate their combined US$2.6 trillion held in foreign cash stockpiles, have utilised the extra capital to buy back shares.Last year, share buybacks in the US stood at a jaw-dropping US$1.1 trillion, prompting an observation by Citigroup Inc that buybacks topped capital expenditures for the first time since 2008.Over in Japan, share buybacks also hit a record in the recent fiscal year. At present, SoftBank Group Corp, Sony and other companies have announced plans to buy back shares worth more than ¥1.3 trillion (RM47.5 billion). Short-term hurrah at the expense of long-term benefits?But these activities have come under increasing attack, especially in the US where politicians are contemplating legislation that revisits buyback rules.Among their arguments are that the companies would do better to focus on improving wages and benefits for their employees, and to invest in R&D before buying back shares.Malaysia’s Minority Shareholders Watch Group (MSWG) also has its views.In the wake of the surge in share buybacks by a number of companies perceived to be linked to the Barisan Nasional administration following the decline in their share prices, the MSWG said, “If a company buys back its shares for the sole purpose of stabilising its share price regardless of the intrinsic value, such action could be tantamount to creating a false market, an offence under the securities laws.”In a weekly newsletter last year, it urged minority shareholders to take a view on whether they agree that their company undertake a share buyback in the event that the share price is substantially lower than the intrinsic value of the stock.The watchdog advised minorities to sell their shares in the company if they disagree with the board’s buyback decision.An analyst with a local research house, however, tells The Edge that most investors and traders look at such strategies positively because they provide an immediate uplift to companies, especially those under selling pressure.“If you have invested in a company and its share price is falling, it is likely that you will welcome the move. The problem is that most investors or traders look at it as an exit plan. As the share price recovers, they can either take profit or cut their losses, so they would not really mind whether it is for the company’s long-term benefit or not,” he says.Other positives from share buybacks include an improvement in sentiment (for potential buyers) as the action by management indicates that the share price is substantially lower than the stock’s intrinsic value.It also decreases the amount of shares outstanding as companies re-absorb a portion of ownership that was previously distributed to investors, leading to improvement in earnings per share (EPS).There is, however, a growing view that the cash used to repurchase shares is at the expense of capital reinvestment.MIDF head of research Mohd Redza Abdul Rahman agrees that companies need to prioritise reinvestment for future growth but acknowledges that there is pressure to provide some cash returns to investors, either directly (through dividend payouts) or indirectly (through share buybacks).He notes that share buybacks are another way to reward shareholders, much like dividend payouts, but they could also help mitigate share price fluctuations.“If there is no immediate capex (capital expenditure) needs, then dividend returns would be much preferred, considering that there is a limit to the number of times a company can do share buybacks, plus there is a need for shareholders’ approval. For dividends, only a final dividend needs shareholders’ approval. Interim dividends are decided by the board of directors,” says Redza. FBM KLCI’s dividend payout ratio breaches 60% amid decline in EPSRedza observes that due to the recent challenging earnings season, companies with an absolute payout commitment would see a higher dividend payout ratio than normal.Last year, the dividend payout ratio for the FBM KLCI component stocks stood at 62.1%, its highest since 2009. Part of the reason was the decline in the total EPS of component stocks by 23.7% to RM79.69 in 2018 from RM104.47 in 2017.Redza also notes that for companies that are majority owned by a single owner or with a strong cash pile, there is stronger motivation for a higher dividend payout.Gan Eng Peng, director of equities strategy and advisory at Affin Hwang Asset Management, believes the higher dividend payout ratio could also be due to lower requirements for capital.“Typically, when businesses go ex-growth, they do not require as much capital, hence the ability to pay out more, especially if the economic conditions remain stable.“We saw this among Singapore banks and believe over time, the same could occur for Malaysian banks, which are well capitalised generally,” he adds.While it is too early to say that Malaysian businesses have reached that point, most investors believe that slower growth will be the new normal.DBS Group equity research analyst Quah He Wei says the uninspiring earnings outlook is expected to persist in Malaysia this year.He has revised the investment bank’s corporate 2019 and 2020 earnings growth forecast downwards to 2% and 7.1% respectively, following the dismal fourth quarter 2018 results where more companies under DBS’ coverage underperformed than outperformed. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/lead-story-malaysia-not-alone-rampup-share-buybacks
"March 15, 2019 17:27 pm +08",YTL,"PM's Dept: If Tabung Haji practices prudent accounting, govt won’t need to take over assets at a premium","KUALA LUMPUR (March 15): The non-performing assets held by Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) have been transferred to Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd, which is wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance, at a hefty premium of RM9.9 billion for assets worth RM10 billion. The premium for the equity stakes in public-listed companies was as high as 36 times (please see list). The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium
"March 15, 2019 09:01 am +08",YTL,Richest Malaysians saw large dissipation of wealth in 2018,"KUALA LUMPUR: Last year was not the best of years for Malaysia’s wealthiest tycoons. Data compiled by Forbes showed that of the 50 richest persons in the country, 30 saw their wealth shrink. Only 11 recorded gains.Sugar baron Robert Kuok, who for the past 23 years has held pole position as Malaysia’s richest person, saw the greatest dissipation of wealth in absolute terms. His US$2 billion (RM8.18 billion) loss in net worth was more than double the next biggest decline of US$900 million suffered byT Ananda Krishnan.Indeed, Public Bank Bhd icon Tan Sri Teh Hong Piow overtook Ananda, whose net worth was hit by the sharp share price fall in his listed companies, pay-TV operator Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd and telcommunications company Maxis Bhd, in the second half of 2018.However, Kuok’s total net worth of US$12.8 billion still outstrips the second richest Malaysian, Tan Sri Quek Leng Chan of the Hong Leong Malaysia Group, whose fortune grew by an impressive US$2.2 billion to US$9.4 billion from US$7.2 billion a year ago.Some US$600 million was also wiped off from the net worth of YTL Group’s Tan Sri Francis Yeoh and his siblings (see table).But in percentage terms, the biggest loser among Malaysia’s top 50 richest was Wong Thean Soon whose net worth plunged 63% to US$280 million following Barisan Nasional’s shock defeat in the 14th general election last year, dragging his company My EG Services Bhd (MyEG) to a four-year low.Wong — the second largest shareholder and managing director of the e-government services provider — was left US$475 million poorer, falling 29 places to 48th position, according to Forbes.Chairperson Datuk Norraesah Mohamad — MyEG’s largest shareholder and the only woman on the list last year — dropped off this year’s top 50.Forbes also highlighted the losses incurred by Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, although he retained his position as the 12th richest person in Malaysia. The tycoon, who controls stakes in MMC Corp Bhd, DRB-Hicom Bhd and Pos Malaysia Bhd, among others, saw a US$200 million erosion to his net worth last year as mega-infrastructure projects were put on hold pending ongoing reviews.For casino king Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, not only was his flagship Genting Bhd caught in a legal spat with former US partners 20th Century Fox and Disney over a planned theme park in Genting Highlands, but its listed unit Genting Malaysia Bhd succumbed to its biggest quarterly loss of RM1.5 billion in the third financial quarter due to an impairment on Genting’s investment in promissory notes issued by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe for the development of an integrated gaming resort in Massachusetts, US.In an article yesterday, Forbes attributed the wealth decline of Malaysia’s richest to a slowing economic growth rate and an 8% decline in the FBM KLCI over the last eight months.The significant depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar was another factor.However, even though six out of 10 of Malaysia’s richest tycoons experienced a drop in net worth, they remain the 10 wealthiest men in the country as at March 2019.Kuok controls the Shangri-La and Kerry group via Hong Kong-listed entities, as well as Singapore’s Wilmar International Ltd and Malaysia’s PPB Group Bhd.The compilation of data was based on stock prices and exchange rates as of Feb 28, and sourced from stock exchanges, government agencies such as the Companies Commission of Malaysia, analysts, private databases and the individuals, said Forbes.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/richest-malaysians-saw-large-dissipation-wealth-2018

"April 17, 2019 16:00 pm +08",PADINI,K-One looking to the cloud for a pot of gold ,"AFTER a turnaround last year, ACE Market-listed box-build manufacturer K-One Technology Bhd is banking on its newly-acquired cloud computing business to shore up its financial performance.According to K-One executive chairman and co-founder Edwin Lim Beng Fook, the global window of opportunity for cloud computing services may be closing within the next three years, but there is still immense opportunity in Southeast Asia.As such, it is important for G-AsiaPacific Sdn Bhd — the cloud computing arm of K-One — to establish itself and gain a foothold in the Asean market, which is a laggard in the sector compared with the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea and China, he tells The Edge in an interview. “Although G-AsiaPacific is already the market leader in Malaysia, our next target is to venture abroad. We have to grab as much low-hanging fruit as we can within a short period of time.”Starting this year, G-AsiaPacific will venture into Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, followed by Singapore in its second phase of expansion. Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia could come after.“We have to spread our arms all over the Asean region. We want to give our potential competitors a run for their money. This game is about who gets there first to garner the market share,” says Lim, 61, who co-founded K-One in 2001.Last month, K-One completed the acquisition of a 60% stake in G-AsiaPacific for RM20.4 million cash. As a whole, the company is valued at RM34 million, representing eight times its annual profit guarantee of RM4.25 million.G-AsiaPacific is a fully integrated cloud advisory and brokerage firm founded by three technopreneurs — Goh Kiang Kiat, Goh Kiang Kian and Chen Kak Toong — in 2008.Lim acknowledges the trio could still grow G-AsiaPacific on their own but, by combining forces, K-One could take the company to the next level within a shorter time.“They were introduced to me by friends almost a year ago. I came to learn that they have done pretty well over the last 10 years, growing from a smallish firm to a medium-sized tech company today. They hope to take the company to greater heights, so we decided to do this.”Interestingly, K-One intends to acquire the remaining 40% of AsiaPacific as early as the second or third quarter of next year, through the issuance of K-One shares to the three founders.In the financial year ended Feb 28, 2018 (FY2018), G-AsiaPacific generated a profit of about RM4 million on revenue of RM17.5 million. Lim says the company has been profitable all along, but has only grown to a respectable size in recent years.“Today, everybody is jumping into the cloud computing space, including Alibaba and Tencent. Then there are Apple and IBM. Some of these companies are expecting cloud services to make the most money for them in the coming years. It is a very important space,” he says. Three main principalsAt the moment, G-AsiaPacific has three principals — Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft. When the time is right, the company aims to take on additional principals.“We are always exploring, we never close our doors. We might secure one or two new principals in the next two years,” says Lim.For perspective, G-AsiaPacific is a distributor for Amazon, Google and Microsoft. The company does not own any physical data and data centres. It helps the clients of the principals manage and migrate their data to the cloud, hosted by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, which own the data centres.“Most of the time, companies have their own in-house servers and back-up servers. But as they grow bigger, rather than storing the data in their own servers, they might as well put it up on the cloud,” says Lim.As for the principals, he says that their capital expenditure and working capital should reduce as they do not have to hire so many employees around the world. “Their preferred business model is to work with partners like us. We hire the technical staff, who will be trained by the principals, and our people do the migration and maintenance on their behalf. We even knock on doors and sign up clients for them.”Currently, G-AsiaPacific has over 3,000 customers in Malaysia, including AirAsia Bhd, Gamuda Land, IJM Corp, Malindo Air, Padini, Royal Selangor, Starbucks and Shiseido.“I believe Malaysians have started to realise the benefits of technology and the cloud, how it can help them to save costs,” says Lim.Following two consecutive years of losses, K-One returned to the black in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY2018), with a net profit of RM5.6 million on revenue of RM73 million.With G-AsiaPacific’s profit guarantee, Lim expects K-One, which has a market capitalisation of RM174.9 million,  to register strong double-digit revenue and profit growth for the next two years at the very least. ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kone-looking-cloud-pot-gold

"March 15, 2019 10:54 am +08",PADINI,Minimal upward ASP expected for consumer sector,"Consumer sector
Maintain neutral on respective sectors: In the recently concluded earnings season, consumer discretionary companies under our coverage, namely Padini Holdings Bhd (neutral, target price [TP]: RM3.59) and AEON Co (M) Bhd (sell; TP: RM1.41)’s earnings improved strongly from the subdued performance recorded in the previous quarter. The recorded earnings for both companies tripled sequentially to RM53.2 million and RM53.5 for Padini and AEON Co respectively as average selling price (ASP) reverted upwards. To recall, in the third quarter of calendar year 2018 (3Q18), retailers revised down the ASP and executed an aggressive marketing campaign to remain competitive during the tax holiday period. Hence, the readjustment of retail pricing post-tax-holiday period coupled with strong spending during the Christmas season and year-end school holidays helped to lift earnings.We gathered that the overall first half of financial year 2019 (1HFY19) same-store-sales growth (SSSG) for Padini improved by 2% year-on-year (y-o-y) (from -2% y-o-y in FY18) while AEON Co’s FY18 SSSG is estimated to increase by 1.8% y-o-y (from -3.4% y-o-y in FY17). This is supported by the tax holiday spending in 3Q18 and the closure of underperforming stores such as AEON Mahkota Cheras as well as 11 stores by Padini in FY18. The closure of these underperforming stores helped to lift the group’s overall earnings. Nonetheless, we expect SSSG to moderate to about 1% y-o-y in FY19 due to the absence of the aforementioned one-off factors.The heightening competition among brick and mortars retailers compounded with the exponential sales growth of online shopping platforms has resulted in an increasingly challenging outlook for consumer discretionary players, particularly in the fashion industry. In view of the shift in preference of shopping platform, Padini and AEON Co have scaled down their store expansion plan as part of their rationalisation strategy. We understand that Padini has reduced new stores opening to four this year (from 10 stores opened in FY18) while AEON Co currently has no concrete plan to open new shopping malls beyond FY19.As consumers are becoming more price-sensitive, we expect a minimal upward revision in ASPs moving forward. Coupled with the moderation of SSSG, we expect the retailers’ profit margin to continue to remain depressed. Hence, in our view, we expect that the recent addition of malls and stores are expected to have a longer breakeven period. We understand that for AEON Co, AEON Kota Baru (first in Kelantan) and AEON Kuching (first in Sarawak) will take approximately six years to break even due to the lower average spending among consumers in these states in comparison to the average four years break-even period for stores located on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia.The local retail market remains challenging as consumer sentiment weakens while retail players are facing ever-increasing competition as new local and foreign retailers are flooding into the local market. In the near term, retail sales will grow driven heavily by promotion and price discounting as consumers will look for value for money purchase as choices are ample. Hence, this will create an unconducive scenario to raise selling prices which will depress profit margins. — MIDF Research, March 14",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/minimal-upward-asp-expected-consumer-sector

(Feb 28, RM3.85)
Upgrade to buy with a target price of RM5: Padini Holdings Bhd’s revenue for the first half of financial year 2019 (1HFY19) increased 4.6% to RM792 million attributed to positive growth from existing stores and with four new ones opened during the quarter. However, 1HFY19 net profit decreased by 13% year-on-year due to a poor performance in the first quarter of FY19 (1QFY19). Padini’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin eroded by 1.4 percentage points, which was attributable to higher staff costs, rentals and store operational costs. Overall, the 1H performance exceeded our expectations, particularly coming off the heels of a surprisingly low 1QFY19.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, 2QFY19 revenue and core earnings increased by a substantial 40% and more than 100% respectively partly due to the Christmas holiday period and a five-day year-end sale as there were lesser festivities in 1QFY19. The higher profit growth can also be explained by efficiency in cost management. Recall that Padini recorded a surprisingly low net profit of RM18 million for 1QFY19. A third interim dividend per share (DPS) of 2.5 sen (2QFY18: 2.5 sen) was declared. We expect a full-year DPS of 11.5 sen, translating into a dividend yield of 3.3%.We remain positive about Padini’s outlook as the company managed to shrug off its issues with rising costs, which resulted in a slump in its 1QFY19 profit. The 2QFY19 results demonstrated resilience and Padini’s ability to improve its profit margin despite cost pressure. On the risk side, its new store openings and cost to retain market share could exert pressure on margins. However, Padini has diversified brand names that appeal to customers, in our view. We expect more stable earnings for the upcoming quarters due to festive periods, that is Chinese New Year in 3QFY19 and Hari Raya in 4QFY19.We make no changes to our earnings forecasts. Padini’s share price has fallen heavily since it reported weak results for 1QFY19 in November 2018. We believe that its current share price has more than fully reflected the lower earnings expected for FY19. — BIMB Securities Research, Feb 28",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/stable-earnings-expected-padinis-upcoming-quarters

"April 01, 2019 16:00 pm +08",AMWAY,Wan Azmi and Terry Tham join forces again ,"TWO old friends, Tan Sri Wan Azmi Wan Hamzah and Datuk Seri Terry Tham,  have come together once again to become partners in business.Last Tuesday, Eastern & Oriental Bhd (E&O) announced that Wan Azmi had taken up a 9.09% stake in the company via a private placement of new shares for RM127.6 million.This is Wan Azmi’s second appearance as a substantial shareholder in E&O. He invested in the company from 2006-2011. Together with Tham and GK Goh Holdings, he sold his shares to Sime Darby Bhd in 2011 at RM2.30 apiece. Now, he has come back in at 98 sen.In 2016, Tham re-emerged as the largest shareholder in E&O with a 21% stake after buying a block of the shares from Sime Darby.In February this year, E&O embarked on a fundraising exercise to raise RM250 million to RM550 million. It needs fresh funding for the next couple of years as the Seri Tanjung Pinang (STP2) reclamation phase is nearing completion. Building work, mainly infrastructure, has started. The high-end property developer also needs funds to pare down its gearing to reduce interest costs.E&O’s fundraising exercise was not well received by the market largely because of depressed sentiment and a property sector that has yet to emerge from the doldrums. In fact, its share price plunged 18% to an eight-year low the day after the cash call was made.So, in these depressed market conditions when cash calls are likely going to be given the cold shoulder, is Wan Azmi helping out an old friend who once, long ago, had done the same for him?By happy coincidence, Wan Azmi is flush with cash from the sale of his 30% stake in SPLASH (Syarikat Pengeluar Air Selangor Holdings Bhd), held through Sweetwater SPV.Wan Azmi says he was asked by his friend what he was going to do with the money. “I said I will look around, I have no plans. Then they asked if I would consider (investing in E&O) if they needed (to raise funds) and I said, show me your plans, tell me your story. It depends on pricing, it depends on a lot of things,” he tells The Edge in an interview.But nothing happened until two weeks ago, when two senior E&O officers went to his office and started negotiations. “That’s when I agreed to pay 98 sen (almost 15% above the market price at the time). My chief investment officer said to me, ‘Boss, you have become soft’,” laughs Wan Azmi.So it is about helping out an old friend?“I value friendship but friendship is not worth RM130 million,” Wan Azmi quips, chuckling. “So if I’m putting in that sort of money, it’s because I think I’m going to get a fair return.”The savvy investor is not too concerned about the current downturn in the property sector and is confident he will get his returns. “I would say, without being too precise about the numbers, I’m really coming in at a good part of the cycle, the bottom end. I don’t know how quickly it’s going to come out of that, but if I take a six-year view, then I’m reasonably confident that I should get a very good return from this investment.”How?“I think, today, during this cycle, a lot of the issues are clearer ... where we had put valuation as a future reclamation, it is now no longer that; a third of that is already delivered. The 253 acres under STP2 must represent Penang’s most prime, high-end residential development area. And it’s ready to go, it’s no longer a twinkle in the eye. You can actually walk on it today.”He adds that E&O’s risk profile has improved very much and the market has allowed him to go in at a considerable discount to what he thought was not an overpayment by Sime Darby in 2011.“So, it’s well poised to take advantage of any recovery and I do expect a recovery … Penang should lead the recovery as it is a little more robust, marketwise, than Kuala Lumpur.”Wan Azmi will probably be putting in more than RM130 million once E&O gives details of its rights issue, which some analysts say could be held in May. He may have to cough up RM30 million to RM40 million if he subscribes for the rights.Analysts opine that its major shareholders — Tham, Sime Darby and Wan Azmi — will likely take up the rights.While the market felt that it takes a brave man to make a cash call at this time of the cycle — a global slowdown and weak demand for higher-end properties — Tham believes that E&O must move on despite the market uncertainties.“In the event of a potential tightening of money supply and credit squeeze, we believe in seizing the opportunity now. Waiting may not necessarily be the better option. By raising funds now, our objective is to have E&O’s position assured for the next few years — a period that is vital to the success of our flagship STP2 development. In so doing, we also invite our valued shareholders to participate in the next growth trajectory of E&O,” he tells The Edge. Ties that bindWan Azmi and Tham’s friendship goes all the way back to the 1970s, when they were students in London. In fact, according to some mutual friends, it was Wan Azmi who bought Tham his first beer and taught him to fill up his first betting slip during those young and wild days.The duo’s business partnership dates back more than 30 years to the late 1980s, when Tham sold his Subang Jaya office to Wan Azmi in return for General Lumber shares. No cash was involved. As Tham tells it: “The land title of the office was immediately used to appease my friend’s uncompromising lenders.”It would appear that Tham was lending his friend a helping hand. And perhaps, today, Wan Azmi is returning the favour, with the confidence that it will bring him fair, if not good, returns. He knows E&O well. “There is little to dislike about the company,” he says.General Lumber was in fact Wan Azmi’s first venture into entrepreneurship after he bought an 8.8% stake in the loss-making company. He successfully turned it around and from there, thanks also to the super bull run of the early 1990s, built his business empire.In his stable were companies such as General Lumber (later known as Land & General), RJ Reynolds Bhd (JTC), Rohas EUCO Industries (which has morphed into Rohas Tecnic) Bell & Order Bhd, Amway (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd and E&O.A triple coronary bypass surgery in 2001 caused him to review his priorities. “That one single event was the start of a steady shift from entrepreneur-manager to detached investor,” Wan Azmi says.Wan Azmi gave up all board positions in PLCs, while strategic and influential-sized stakes were pared down and treated as portfolio investments. “However, some entrepreneurial initiatives had to be progressed; SPLASH was a case in point.” Since then, Wan Azmi has kept a low profile but he has investments not only domestically but abroad.His current overseas investments include strategic substantial stakes in Steppe Cement (Kazakhstan’s largest cement manufacturer) and PureCircle Ltd (the leading producer of natural zero calorie sweetener from stevia), both of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange.Does he enjoy being an investor more? Everything has its own time, he says. “When I decided to move away from direct entrepreneur to detached investor, it suited me and my character at that stage in my life. I don’t think I could have done  it when I was younger, when I was full of energy, bubbling with ideas and wanting to get into fist fights.“But at this stage in my life, this is a lot better. Detachment gives you clarity; you see issues better and you are also not so captive to your own ego and refuse to admit that maybe your judgement is not so correct … It’s easier now because you don’t make those decisions — it places you in an objective position.”Tham, on the other hand, is mainly London-based these days. Technology has made it possible for him to stay on top of things in Malaysia.  ",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/wan-azmi-and-terry-tham-join-forces-again

The 29.8% stake in TH Heavy Engineering Bhd is an example. Urusharta Jamaah paid RM380.3 million for the block of 334.16 million shares, compared with its market value of RM10.02 million. The lowest premium is on the block of 65.51 million shares in MISC Bhd, which was transferred at RM486.53 million, or a 10.85% premium over its value of RM438.93 million at end-2018, according to the list attached to the written reply from Prime Minister Departments (PMD) to Dewan Rakyat yesterday.PMD highlighted in the reply that if prudent accounting standard was practiced by LTH in the past, the pilgrim fund would have been able to continue holding onto these assets. Its reply said the assets acquired by Urusharta can be categorised into three types: properties, a non-listed company, and public listed securities.Urusharta is a special purpose vehicle set up by the government to revive LTH’s financial health caused by the large deficit between its assets and liabilities. It is acquiring the pilgrims fund’s underperforming properties and equities in exchange for RM10 billion in non-tradable sukuk, and RM9.9 billion in Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares as part of its restructuring plan.By exchanging its RM10 billion non-performing assets for RM19.9 billion worth of sukuk and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares, it will help remove the pilgrim fund’s massive impairments on its assets.  The restructuring plan will ensure the fund will be able to make hibah distributions according to the Tabung Haji Act 1995, said PMD.PMD said overall, the assets transferred from LTH to the SPV comprises 29 properties, one company that is not public listed, and equity stake or derivatives in 106 public listed companies.“If a prudent impairment rate has been practiced previously by the old management, not at 90% level, and the provision of impairment is made on the profit and loss statements in the past years, of course, LTH will be capable of continuing to hold all of these shares,” it added.PMD pointed out that over the past few years, all of these equity losses were parked under ‘other reserves’ in LTH’s financial statements in order to continue showing high profit, and to ensure there were hibah payments every year. Consequently, this has resulted in the widening gap between its assets and liabilities.PMD said based on LTH’s audited financial statements for 2017, ‘other reserves’ shows a negative value of RM4.6 billion.Therefore, PMD said the government’s intention is to restore LTH’s financial position by taking over these losses to close the widening deficit.PMD said Urusharta Jamaah’s role now is to implement rehabilitation for these assets through warehousing strategy and restructuring, while continuing the operations of the transferred assets to maximise their recovery value.On top of that, PMD said Urusharta Jamaah will redeem all the financial instruments it issued and subscribed by LTH.The issue of LTH's asset transfers was raised by Ahmad Amzad Mohamed @ Hashim (PAS-Kuala Terengganu) yesterday, who had asked the Prime Minister to state the value of each asset (equity and property) that has been transferred to Syarikat Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd by LTH.PropertiesNon-listed CompanyDomestic equity securities",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/pms-dept-if-tabung-haji-practices-prudent-accounting-govt-wont-need-take-over-assets-premium

"March 15, 2019 19:44 pm +08",TASEK,Palm oil charts third weekly loss on demand woes,"SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR (March 15): Malaysian palm oil futures charted a third consecutive week of declines on Friday evening on concerns over demand from top buyers China and India, though prices reversed some losses to end the trading day slightly higher. Abundant supplies in key consumers of the tropical product are expected to weigh on the market, although the downside is limited, traders said.
 
The benchmark third-month palm oil contract on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was up 0.15% at 2,066  ringgit (US$505.26) a tonne by the end of the trading day. Earlier in the session, it dropped to its weakest since mid-December at 2,038 ringgit a tonne.""There is some scope for prices to decline, but as soon as the third-month contract drops below 2,000 ringgit a tonne, buying will kick in,"" said one Singapore-based trader who supplies palm oil to India.Palm oil is down 2.8% this week, and has shed 2.6% since the start of the month.European nations were cutting down on palm oil consumption due to environmental concerns.The European Commission says palm oil cultivation causes deforestation and its use in transport fuel should be phased out, putting it on a collision course with big palm oil producers like Malaysia and Indonesia.The Commission published its criteria on Wednesday for determining what crops cause environmental harm, part of a new EU push to boost the share of renewable energy to 32% by 2030 and determine appropriate renewable sources.In related oils, Chicago soybean oil was down 0.3% and the soyoil contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange dropped 1.5%. Palm, soy and crude oil prices at 1055 GMT Contract           Month    Last  Change     Low    High  Volume

"March 11, 2019 09:51 am +08",TASEK,Ten stocks to look at if ECRL revival materialises,"KUALA LUMPUR: The sudden surge in the share price of Lafarge Malaysia Bhd last Thursday left investors mulling over its unexpected climb, with the potential revival of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) being touted as the most plausible reason.Towards the end of his official visit to Manila last week, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad reportedly told the media that Putrajaya’s stance remains the same: that it prefers to avoid an astronomical compensation and is trying to strike a deal with China to build the rail line at a more affordable price tag.Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng also reportedly said that he hopes the ECRL negotiation between Malaysia and China can be concluded before Dr Mahathir’s scheduled second official visit to China for the Belt and Road Summit 2019 next month.As the events unfold, there may be investment opportunities for investors looking for exposure to the construction sector, beaten down for the greater part of last year due to political uncertainties in the wake of a new government, then made worse by the review of mega infrastructure projects.Based on feedback from construction sector analysts, The Edge Financial Daily outlines 10 stocks that could be potential beneficiaries should the ECRL project be revived.In no particular order, they are Gabungan AQRS Bhd, HSS Engineers Bhd, IJM Corp Bhd, Lafarge, Econpile Holdings Bhd, Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd (MRCB), Advancecon Holdings Bhd, Gadang Holdings Bhd, WCT Holdings Bhd and Fajarbaru Builder Group Bhd.Assuming Lafarge’s and HSS Engineers’ previous contracts can be reinstated, RHB Research analyst Tay Yow Ken believes these two counters would be the clearest beneficiaries.“Looking back to before the project was shelved, HSS Engineers and Lafarge were respectively awarded contracts worth RM82.5 million and RM270 million. Hence, we believe these companies are the clearest beneficiaries if the project is revived, assuming their previous contracts are reinstated as well,” he said in an email response.Tay also noted that ECRL’s main contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd, had yet to award engineering and construction packages when the project was suspended in July last year.“In our view, the extent local contractors are able to benefit would very much depend on the project structure after negotiations conclude, assuming the outcome is positive. That includes items such as local content requirement and what’s left on the table in terms of profit margins. Remember that the revived project will be subject to cost cuts and changes in design.“According to our ground checks, quite a number of contractors had expressed their interest in bidding for contracts as the pie was large. That included the likes of IJM Corp, Advancecon, Gabungan AQRS and Econpile. More recently, MRCB told analysts during a recent conference call that it would be interested to participate in the project if tenders were called,” he said.Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd analyst Kenneth Leong said Gadang Holdings, WCT Holdings and Fajarbaru Builder could also see some interest given their construction capabilities.“These companies have rail project experience so we wouldn’t want to rule out the possibility of them tendering for packages,” he said over the phone.However, Leong cautioned that in general, profit margins for construction contracts are small, and with a lower price tag for ECRL, the margins could be even smaller.“We can already see some players, like Econpile, affected by the revised contract value for building the second MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) line,” he said.Econpile posted a net loss of RM34.45 million for the second quarter of financial year 2019 (2QFY19) ended Dec 31, 2018, against a net profit of RM22.73 million a year ago. Revenue also fell by 8.6% to RM148.18 million, from RM162.17 million in 2QFY18.The piling expert said its bottom line was hurt by loss of RM18.5 million owing to a delay and idling costs from two infrastructure projects caused by overall project rationalisation of costs and changes in design and/or scope of work by main contractors, and a RM15.4 million cost overrun in a property development project.Meanwhile, in a note to investors last week, Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Khairul Azizi Kairudin said news of a potential revival of the ECRL also pushed up the share price of Tasek Corp Bhd and Hume Industries Bhd, two other cement players.“However, we reckon that the ECRL alone will be insufficient to spur demand to overcome industry overcapacity. To recap, Lafarge won a RM270 million cement supply contract for the ECRL back in March 2018. Based on the contract period of two years, this translates into RM135 million per annum, which only forms 6.4% of [Lafarge’s] financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 revenue,” he wrote.Malacca Securities’ Leong observes that investors could take advantage of the current positive sentiments, but believes it is better to wait for more details from Dr Mahathir’s trip to China in April.",https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ten-stocks-look-if-ecrl-revival-materialises
